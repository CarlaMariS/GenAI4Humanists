JOHNSON, by Executive Order No. 11130 dated\r\nNovember 29, 1963,[F-1] created this Commission to investigate the\r\nassassination on November 22, 1963, of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the\r\n35th President of the United States. The President directed the\r\nCommission to evaluate all the facts and circumstances surrounding the\r\nassassination and the subsequent killing of the alleged assassin and to\r\nreport its findings and conclusions to him.[F-2]\r\n\r\nThe subject of the Commission\u2019s inquiry was a chain of events which\r\nsaddened and shocked the people of the United States and of the world.\r\nThe assassination of President Kennedy and the simultaneous wounding\r\nof John B. Connally, Jr., Governor of Texas, had been followed within\r\nan hour by the slaying of Patrolman J.\u00a0D. Tippit of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment. In the United States and abroad, these events evoked\r\nuniversal demands for an explanation.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the assassination, State and local officials in\r\nDallas devoted their resources to the apprehension of the assassin.\r\nThe U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for the protection\r\nof the President, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation began an\r\ninvestigation at the direction of President Johnson. Within 35 minutes\r\nof the killing of Patrolman Tippit, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested\r\nby the Dallas police as a suspect in that crime. Based on evidence\r\nprovided by Federal, State, and local agencies, the State of Texas\r\narraigned Oswald within 12 hours of his arrest, charging him with the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy and the murder of Patrolman Tippit.\r\nOn November 24, 1963, less than 48 hours after his arrest, Oswald was\r\nfatally shot in the basement of the Dallas Police Department by Jack\r\nRuby, a Dallas nightclub owner. This shooting took place in full view\r\nof a national television audience.\r\n\r\nThe events of these 2 days were witnessed with shock and disbelief\r\nby a Nation grieving the loss of its young leader. Throughout the\r\nworld, reports on these events were disseminated in massive detail.\r\nTheories and speculations mounted regarding the assassination. In many\r\ninstances, the intense public demand for facts was met by partial\r\nand frequently conflicting reports from Dallas and elsewhere. After\r\nOswald\u2019s arrest and his denial of all guilt, public attention focused\r\nboth on the extent of the evidence against him and the possibility of\r\na conspiracy, domestic or foreign. His subsequent death heightened\r\npublic interest and stimulated additional suspicions and rumors.", "start_char_idx": 2758, "end_char_idx": 6659, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65253e88-1473-4846-aa69-405e1fca1333": {"__data__": {"id_": "65253e88-1473-4846-aa69-405e1fca1333", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f7691e5-1b36-4ceb-a1b0-f39b914af222", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "06dd28c40319fdacca7cea0b5ee8dc0cd95893abe5ab298c6969ae86116e18ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3224b2ed-dece-4455-ba52-b2d4fb0c345c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0ecd7845fbafb632054c96dc2ebd815ebc9ffeb3cf4a850a50b477c03f6b9c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "On November 24, 1963, less than 48 hours after his arrest, Oswald was\r\nfatally shot in the basement of the Dallas Police Department by Jack\r\nRuby, a Dallas nightclub owner.

His subsequent death heightened\r\npublic interest and stimulated additional suspicions and rumors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSION AND ITS POWERS\r\n\r\nAfter Lee Harvey Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby, it was no longer\r\npossible to arrive at the complete story of the assassination through\r\nnormal judicial procedures during a trial of the alleged assassin.\r\nAlternative means for instituting a complete investigation were widely\r\ndiscussed. Federal and State officials conferred on the possibility of\r\ninitiating a court of inquiry before a State magistrate in Texas. An\r\ninvestigation by the grand jury of Dallas County also was considered.\r\nAs speculation about the existence of a foreign or domestic conspiracy\r\nbecame widespread, committees in both Houses of Congress weighed the\r\ndesirability of congressional hearings to discover all the facts\r\nrelating to the assassination.\r\n\r\nBy his order of November 29 establishing the Commission, President\r\nJohnson sought to avoid parallel investigations and to concentrate\r\nfactfinding in a body having the broadest national mandate. As Chairman\r\nof the Commission, President Johnson selected Earl Warren, Chief\r\nJustice of the United States, former Governor and attorney general of\r\nthe State of California. From the U.S. Senate, he chose Richard B.\r\nRussell, Democratic Senator from Georgia and chairman of the Senate\r\nArmed Services Committee, former Governor of, and county attorney in,\r\nthe State of Georgia, and John Sherman Cooper, Republican Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky, former county and circuit judge, State of Kentucky,\r\nand U.S. Ambassador to India. Two members of the Commission were\r\ndrawn from the U.S. House of Representatives: Hale Boggs, Democratic\r\nU.S. Representative from Louisiana and majority whip, and Gerald R.\r\nFord, Republican, U.S. Representative from Michigan and chairman of\r\nthe House Republican Conference. From private life, President Johnson\r\nselected two lawyers by profession, both of whom have served in the\r\nadministrations of Democratic and Republican Presidents: Allen W.\r\nDulles, former Director of Central Intelligence, and John J. McCloy,\r\nformer President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and\r\nDevelopment, former U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, and during\r\nWorld War II, the Assistant Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nFrom its first meeting on December 5, 1963, the Commission viewed the\r\nExecutive order as an unequivocal Presidential mandate to conduct a\r\nthorough and independent investigation. Because of the numerous rumors\r\nand theories, the Commission concluded that the public interest in\r\ninsuring that the truth was ascertained could not be met by merely\r\naccepting the reports or the analyses of Federal or State agencies.\r\nNot only were the premises and conclusions of those reports critically\r\nreassessed, but all assertions or rumors relating to a possible\r\nconspiracy, or the complicity of others than Oswald, which have come to\r\nthe attention of the Commission, were investigated.\r\n\r\nOn December 13, 1963, Congress enacted Senate Joint Resolution 137\r\n(Public Law 88-202)[F-3] empowering the Commission to issue subpoenas\r\nrequiring the testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence\r\nrelating to any matter under its investigation. In addition, the\r\nresolution authorized the Commission to compel testimony from witnesses\r\nclaiming the privilege against self-incrimination under the fifth\r\namendment to the U.S. Constitution by providing for the grant of\r\nimmunity to persons testifying under such compulsion. Immunity under\r\nthese provisions was not granted to any witness during the Commission\u2019s\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nThe Commission took steps immediately to obtain the necessary staff\r\nto fulfill its assignment. J. Lee Rankin, former Solicitor General of\r\nthe United States, was sworn in as general counsel for the Commission\r\non December 16, 1963.

J. Lee Rankin, former Solicitor General of\r\nthe United States, was sworn in as general counsel for the Commission\r\non December 16, 1963. Additional members of the legal staff were\r\nselected during the next few weeks. The Commission has been aided by 14\r\nassistant counsel with high professional qualifications, selected by it\r\nfrom widely separated parts of the United States. This staff undertook\r\nthe work of the Commission with a wealth of legal and investigative\r\nexperience and a total dedication to the determination of the truth.\r\nThe Commission has been assisted also by highly qualified personnel\r\nfrom several Federal agencies, assigned to the Commission at its\r\nrequest. This group included lawyers from the Department of Justice,\r\nagents of the Internal Revenue Service, a senior historian from the\r\nDepartment of Defense, an editor from the Department of State, and\r\nsecretarial and administrative staff supplied by the General Services\r\nAdministration and other agencies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the assistance afforded by Federal agencies,\r\nthe Commission throughout its inquiry had the cooperation of\r\nrepresentatives of the city of Dallas and the State of Texas. The\r\nattorney general of Texas, Waggoner Carr, aided by two distinguished\r\nlawyers of that State, Robert G. Storey of Dallas, retired dean of\r\nthe Southern Methodist University Law School and former president of\r\nthe American Bar Association, and Leon Jaworski of Houston, former\r\npresident of the Texas State Bar Association, has been fully informed\r\nat all times as to the progress of the investigation, and has advanced\r\nsuch suggestions as he and his special assistants considered helpful\r\nto the accomplishment of the Commission\u2019s assignment. Attorney General\r\nCarr has promptly supplied the Commission with pertinent information\r\npossessed by Texas officials. Dallas officials, particularly those from\r\nthe police department, have fully complied with all requests made by\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nDuring December and early January the Commission received an increasing\r\nvolume of reports from Federal and State investigative agencies. Of\r\nprincipal importance was the five-volume report of the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation, submitted on December 9, 1963, which summarized\r\nthe results of the investigation conducted by the Bureau immediately\r\nafter the assassination. After reviewing this report, the Commission\r\nrequested the Federal Bureau of Investigation to furnish the underlying\r\ninvestigative materials relied upon in the summary report. The first\r\ninvestigative reports submitted in response to this request were\r\ndelivered to the Commission on December 20, 1963. On December 18, the\r\nSecret Service submitted a detailed report on security precautions\r\ntaken before President Kennedy\u2019s trip to Texas and a summary of the\r\nevents of November 22, as witnessed by Secret Service agents. A few\r\ndays later the Department of State submitted a report relating to\r\nOswald\u2019s defection to the Soviet Union in 1959, and his return to the\r\nUnited States in 1962. On January 7 and 11, 1964, the attorney general\r\nof Texas submitted an extensive set of investigative materials, largely\r\nDallas police reports, on the assassination of President Kennedy and\r\nthe killing of Oswald.\r\n\r\nAs these investigative reports were received, the staff began\r\nanalyzing and summarizing them. The members of the legal staff,\r\ndivided into teams, proceeded to organize the facts revealed by\r\nthese investigations, determine the issues, sort out the unresolved\r\nproblems, and recommend additional investigation by the Commission.\r\nSimultaneously, to insure that no relevant information would be\r\noverlooked, the Commission directed requests to the 10 major\r\ndepartments of the Federal Government, 14 of its independent agencies\r\nor commissions, and 4 congressional committees for all information\r\nrelating to the assassination or the background and activities of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the accumulating materials, the Commission directed\r\nnumerous additional requests to Federal and State investigative\r\nagencies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service\r\nexecuted the detailed requests for statements of witnesses and\r\nexaminations of physical evidence with dispatch and thoroughness. All\r\nthese reports were reviewed and analyzed by the Commission. Additional\r\ninvestigative requests, where appropriate, were handled by Internal\r\nRevenue Service, Department of State, and the military intelligence\r\nagencies with comparable skill.", "start_char_idx": 9791, "end_char_idx": 14832, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25e4298b-d92d-4924-9b21-e85f680b3d54": {"__data__": {"id_": "25e4298b-d92d-4924-9b21-e85f680b3d54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3224b2ed-dece-4455-ba52-b2d4fb0c345c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "4b190a6b8eafcd5e2a7ebd87651e7063d9613da555a2c1588dad73ca6bd91fb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3df5b59f-b0d0-4332-bb4c-4dc37e7c8fa4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b76cedc7eef8b83eaa7b77ab17dfcd1d7323e88de7ecc2da8713b440b12f3454", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Simultaneously, to insure that no relevant information would be\r\noverlooked, the Commission directed requests to the 10 major\r\ndepartments of the Federal Government, 14 of its independent agencies\r\nor commissions, and 4 congressional committees for all information\r\nrelating to the assassination or the background and activities of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the accumulating materials, the Commission directed\r\nnumerous additional requests to Federal and State investigative\r\nagencies.

Investigative analyses of particular\r\nsignificance and sensitivity in the foreign areas were contributed\r\nby the Central Intelligence Agency. On occasion the Commission used\r\nindependent experts from State and city governments to supplement or\r\nverify information. During the investigation the Commission on several\r\noccasions visited the scene of the assassination and other places in\r\nthe Dallas area pertinent to the inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe scope and detail of the investigative effort by the Federal and\r\nState agencies are suggested in part by statistics from the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation and the Secret Service. Immediately after the\r\nassassination more than 80 additional FBI personnel were transferred to\r\nthe Dallas office on a temporary basis to assist in the investigation.\r\nBeginning November 22, 1963, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nconducted approximately 25,000 interviews and reinterviews of persons\r\nhaving information of possible relevance to the investigation and by\r\nSeptember 11, 1964, submitted over 2,300 reports totaling approximately\r\n25,400 pages to the Commission. During the same period the Secret\r\nService conducted approximately 1,550 interviews and submitted 800\r\nreports totaling some 4,600 pages.\r\n\r\nBecause of the diligence, cooperation, and facilities of Federal\r\ninvestigative agencies, it was unnecessary for the Commission to\r\nemploy investigators other than the members of the Commission\u2019s legal\r\nstaff. The Commission recognized, however, that special measures were\r\nrequired whenever the facts or rumors called for an appraisal of the\r\nacts of the agencies themselves. The staff reviewed in detail the\r\nactions of several Federal agencies, particularly the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation, the Secret Service, the Central Intelligence Agency,\r\nand the Department of State. Initially the Commission requested the\r\nagencies to furnish all their reports relating to the assassination\r\nand their relationships with Oswald or Ruby. On the basis of these\r\nreports, the Commission submitted specific questions to the agency\r\ninvolved. Members of the staff followed up the answers by reviewing\r\nthe relevant files of each agency for additional information. In some\r\ninstances, members of the Commission also reviewed the files in person.\r\nFinally, the responsible officials of these agencies were called to\r\ntestify under oath. Dean Rusk, Secretary of State; C. Douglas Dillon,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury; John A. McCone, Director of the Central\r\nIntelligence Agency; J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation; and James J. Rowley, Chief of the Secret Service,\r\nappeared as witnesses and testified fully regarding their agencies\u2019\r\nparticipation in the matters under scrutiny by the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION HEARINGS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the information resulting from these investigations, the\r\nCommission has relied primarily on the facts disclosed by the sworn\r\ntestimony of the principal witnesses to the assassination and related\r\nevents. Beginning on February 3, 1964, the Commission and its staff\r\nhas taken the testimony of 552 witnesses. Of this number, 94 appeared\r\nbefore members of the Commission; 395 were questioned by members of\r\nthe Commission\u2019s legal staff; 61 supplied sworn affidavits; and 2\r\ngave statements.[F-4] Under Commission procedures, all witnesses were\r\nadvised that they had the right to the presence and the advice of their\r\nlawyer during the interrogation, with the corollary rights to raise\r\nobjections to any questions asked, to make any clarifying statement on\r\nthe record after the interrogation, and to purchase a copy of their\r\ntestimony.[F-5]\r\n\r\nCommission hearings were closed to the public unless the witness\r\nappearing before the Commission requested an open hearing. Under these\r\nprocedures, testimony of one witness was taken in a public hearing\r\non two occasions.

Under these\r\nprocedures, testimony of one witness was taken in a public hearing\r\non two occasions. No other witness requested a public hearing. The\r\nCommission concluded that the premature publication by it of testimony\r\nregarding the assassination or the subsequent killing of Oswald might\r\ninterfere with Ruby\u2019s rights to a fair and impartial trial on the\r\ncharges filed against him by the State of Texas. The Commission also\r\nrecognized that testimony would be presented before it which would\r\nbe inadmissible in judicial proceedings and might prejudice innocent\r\nparties if made public out of context. In addition to the witnesses\r\nwho appeared before the Commission, numerous others provided sworn\r\ndepositions, affidavits, and statements upon which the Commission\r\nhas relied. Since this testimony, as well as that taken before the\r\nCommission, could not always be taken in logical sequence, the\r\nCommission concluded that partial publication of testimony as the\r\ninvestigation progressed was impractical and could be misleading.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSION\u2019S FUNCTION\r\n\r\nThe Commission\u2019s most difficult assignments have been to uncover\r\nall the facts concerning the assassination of President Kennedy and\r\nto determine if it was in any way directed or encouraged by unknown\r\npersons at home or abroad. In this process, its objective has been to\r\nidentify the person or persons responsible for both the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy and the killing of Oswald through an examination\r\nof the evidence. The task has demanded unceasing appraisal of the\r\nevidence by the individual members of the Commission in their effort to\r\ndiscover the whole truth.\r\n\r\nThe procedures followed by the Commission in developing and assessing\r\nevidence necessarily differed from those of a court conducting a\r\ncriminal trial of a defendant present before it, since under our system\r\nthere is no provision for a posthumous trial. If Oswald had lived he\r\ncould have had a trial by American standards of justice where he would\r\nhave been able to exercise his full rights under the law. A judge and\r\njury would have presumed him innocent until proven guilty beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt. He might have furnished information which could have\r\naffected the course of his trial. He could have participated in and\r\nguided his defense. There could have been an examination to determine\r\nwhether he was sane under prevailing legal standards. All witnesses,\r\nincluding possibly the defendant, could have been subjected to\r\nsearching examination under the adversary system of American trials.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has functioned neither as a court presiding over an\r\nadversary proceeding nor as a prosecutor determined to prove a case,\r\nbut as a factfinding agency committed to the ascertainment of the\r\ntruth. In the course of the investigation of the facts and rumors\r\nsurrounding these matters, it was necessary to explore hearsay and\r\nother sources of information not admissible in a court proceeding\r\nobtained from persons who saw or heard and others in a position to\r\nobserve what occurred. In fairness to the alleged assassin and his\r\nfamily, the Commission on February 25, 1964, requested Walter E.\r\nCraig, president of the American Bar Association, to participate in\r\nthe investigation and to advise the Commission whether in his opinion\r\nthe proceedings conformed to the basic principles of American justice.\r\nMr. Craig accepted this assignment and participated fully and without\r\nlimitation. He attended Commission hearings in person or through his\r\nappointed assistants. All working papers, reports, and other data in\r\nCommission files were made available, and Mr. Craig and his associates\r\nwere given the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, to recall any\r\nwitness heard prior to his appointment, and to suggest witnesses whose\r\ntestimony they would like to have the Commission hear. This procedure\r\nwas agreeable to counsel for Oswald\u2019s widow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSION\u2019S REPORT\r\n\r\nIn this report the Commission submits the results of its investigation.\r\nEach member of the Commission has given careful consideration to\r\nthe entire report and concurs in its findings and conclusions.", "start_char_idx": 17943, "end_char_idx": 22766, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34efa1ca-2396-47ec-b048-36621606e48f": {"__data__": {"id_": "34efa1ca-2396-47ec-b048-36621606e48f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3df5b59f-b0d0-4332-bb4c-4dc37e7c8fa4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "7773cc2c594755ad7b441b607c46c9a51b49ea9558f1e30b00e304ca5c52ccc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3eaef542-8694-41b9-a950-3980d2df5726", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4b756fc8a079acb654478d24bc1b242d8301d34cb846cddef3250e3ed98f54d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Mr. Craig accepted this assignment and participated fully and without\r\nlimitation.

A young and vigorous leader\r\nwhose years of public and private life stretched before him was the\r\nvictim of the fourth Presidential assassination in the history of a\r\ncountry dedicated to the concepts of reasoned argument and peaceful\r\npolitical change. This Commission was created on November 29, 1963,\r\nin recognition of the right of people everywhere to full and truthful\r\nknowledge concerning these events. This report endeavors to fulfill\r\nthat right and to appraise this tragedy by the light of reason and the\r\nstandard of fairness. It has been prepared with a deep awareness of\r\nthe Commission\u2019s responsibility to present to the American people an\r\nobjective report of the facts relating to the assassination.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF EVENTS\r\n\r\nAt 11:40 a.m., c.s.t., on Friday, November 22, 1963, President John\r\nF. Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy, and their party arrived at Love Field,\r\nDallas, Tex. Behind them was the first day of a Texas trip planned\r\n5 months before by the President, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson,\r\nand John B. Connally, Jr., Governor of Texas. After leaving the White\r\nHouse on Thursday morning, the President had flown initially to San\r\nAntonio where Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson joined the party and\r\nthe President dedicated new research facilities at the U.S. Air Force\r\nSchool of Aerospace Medicine. Following a testimonial dinner in Houston\r\nfor U.S. Representative Albert Thomas, the President flew to Fort Worth\r\nwhere he spent the night and spoke at a large breakfast gathering on\r\nFriday.\r\n\r\nPlanned for later that day were a motorcade through downtown Dallas,\r\na luncheon speech at the Trade Mart, and a flight to Austin where\r\nthe President would attend a reception and speak at a Democratic\r\nfundraising dinner.", "start_char_idx": 43772, "end_char_idx": 49626, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "247f782c-0e17-4100-a192-615d19a7bb32": {"__data__": {"id_": "247f782c-0e17-4100-a192-615d19a7bb32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c76f3493-bf93-474a-b12f-c527976b46df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "629b7cea8700bc523134fac35a39aad0ce5132ea0d30182d2531e7558b6ca911", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "de549942-252e-4474-acd7-94026a234dbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5b610c496df575731f184ea7be2a1933452a1a564ddb45b6b8315571b853165a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Kennedy, and their party arrived at Love Field,\r\nDallas, Tex. Behind them was the first day of a Texas trip planned\r\n5 months before by the President, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson,\r\nand John B. Connally, Jr., Governor of Texas. After leaving the White\r\nHouse on Thursday morning, the President had flown initially to San\r\nAntonio where Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson joined the party and\r\nthe President dedicated new research facilities at the U.S. Air Force\r\nSchool of Aerospace Medicine. Following a testimonial dinner in Houston\r\nfor U.S. Representative Albert Thomas, the President flew to Fort Worth\r\nwhere he spent the night and spoke at a large breakfast gathering on\r\nFriday.\r\n\r\nPlanned for later that day were a motorcade through downtown Dallas,\r\na luncheon speech at the Trade Mart, and a flight to Austin where\r\nthe President would attend a reception and speak at a Democratic\r\nfundraising dinner. From Austin he would proceed to the Texas ranch of\r\nthe Vice President. Evident on this trip were the varied roles which\r\nan American President performs--Head of State, Chief Executive, party\r\nleader, and, in this instance, prospective candidate for reelection.\r\n\r\nThe Dallas motorcade, it was hoped, would evoke a demonstration of the\r\nPresident\u2019s personal popularity in a city which he had lost in the 1960\r\nelection. Once it had been decided that the trip to Texas would span 2\r\ndays, those responsible for planning, primarily Governor Connally and\r\nKenneth O\u2019Donnell, a special assistant to the President, agreed that\r\na motorcade through Dallas would be desirable. The Secret Service was\r\ntold on November 8 that 45 minutes had been allotted to a motorcade\r\nprocession from Love Field to the site of a luncheon planned by Dallas\r\nbusiness and civic leaders in honor of the President. After considering\r\nthe facilities and security problems of several buildings, the Trade\r\nMart was chosen as the luncheon site. Given this selection, and in\r\naccordance with the customary practice of affording the greatest number\r\nof people an opportunity to see the President, the motorcade route\r\nselected was a natural one. The route was approved by the local host\r\ncommittee and White House representatives on November 18 and publicized\r\nin the local papers starting on November 19. This advance publicity\r\nmade it clear that the motorcade would leave Main Street and pass the\r\nintersection of Elm and Houston Streets as it proceeded to the Trade\r\nMart by way of the Stemmons Freeway.\r\n\r\nBy midmorning of November 22, clearing skies in Dallas dispelled the\r\nthreat of rain and the President greeted the crowds from his open\r\nlimousine without the \u201cbubbletop,\u201d which was at that time a plastic\r\nshield furnishing protection only against inclement weather. To the\r\nleft of the President in the rear seat was Mrs. Kennedy. In the jump\r\nseats were Governor Connally, who was in front of the President, and\r\nMrs. Connally at the Governor\u2019s left. Agent William R. Greer of the\r\nSecret Service was driving, and Agent Roy H. Kellerman was sitting to\r\nhis right.\r\n\r\nDirectly behind the Presidential limousine was an open \u201cfollowup\u201d car\r\nwith eight Secret Service agents, two in the front seat, two in the\r\nrear, and two on each running board. These agents, in accordance with\r\nnormal Secret Service procedures, were instructed to scan the crowds,\r\nthe roofs, and windows of buildings, overpasses, and crossings for\r\nsigns of trouble. Behind the \u201cfollowup\u201d car was the Vice-Presidential\r\ncar carrying the Vice President and Mrs. Johnson and Senator Ralph W.\r\nYarborough. Next were a Vice-Presidential \u201cfollowup\u201d car and several\r\ncars and buses for additional dignitaries, press representatives, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe motorcade left Love Field shortly after 11:50 a.m., and proceeded\r\nthrough residential neighborhoods, stopping twice at the President\u2019s\r\nrequest to greet well-wishers among the friendly crowds. Each time\r\nthe President\u2019s car halted, Secret Service agents from the \u201cfollowup\u201d\r\ncar moved forward to assume a protective stance near the President\r\nand Mrs. Kennedy. As the motorcade reached Main Street, a principal\r\neast-west artery in downtown Dallas, the welcome became tumultuous.\r\nAt the extreme west end of Main Street the motorcade turned right on\r\nHouston Street and proceeded north for one block in order to make a\r\nleft turn on Elm Street, the most direct and convenient approach to the\r\nStemmons Freeway and the Trade Mart.", "start_char_idx": 48711, "end_char_idx": 53154, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de549942-252e-4474-acd7-94026a234dbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "de549942-252e-4474-acd7-94026a234dbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "247f782c-0e17-4100-a192-615d19a7bb32", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "895cf8f7fe2ea5f04a197848c0eb53fa29a4c1e834df1840be43ade6c527734b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2ecec0e-45a1-4f12-95b0-f6368a13c5e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dbfc522bd953329ae73bcda5772da1883b32c024558d3d567dd1c51e41fa7453", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Next were a Vice-Presidential \u201cfollowup\u201d car and several\r\ncars and buses for additional dignitaries, press representatives, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe motorcade left Love Field shortly after 11:50 a.m., and proceeded\r\nthrough residential neighborhoods, stopping twice at the President\u2019s\r\nrequest to greet well-wishers among the friendly crowds.

As the President\u2019s car approached\r\nthe intersection of Houston and Elm Streets, there loomed directly\r\nahead on the intersection\u2019s northwest corner a seven-story, orange\r\nbrick warehouse and office building, the Texas School Book Depository.\r\nRiding in the Vice President\u2019s car, Agent Rufus W. Youngblood of the\r\nSecret Service noticed that the clock atop the building indicated 12:30\r\np.m., the scheduled arrival time at the Trade Mart.\r\n\r\nThe President\u2019s car which had been going north made a sharp turn\r\ntoward the southwest onto Elm Street. At a speed of about 11 miles per\r\nhour, it started down the gradual descent toward a railroad overpass\r\nunder which the motorcade would proceed before reaching the Stemmons\r\nFreeway. The front of the Texas School Book Depository was now on the\r\nPresident\u2019s right, and he waved to the crowd assembled there as he\r\npassed the building. Dealey Plaza--an open, landscaped area marking the\r\nwestern end of downtown Dallas--stretched out to the President\u2019s left.\r\nA Secret Service agent riding in the motorcade radioed the Trade Mart\r\nthat the President would arrive in 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nSeconds later shots resounded in rapid succession. The President\u2019s\r\nhands moved to his neck. He appeared to stiffen momentarily and lurch\r\nslightly forward in his seat. A bullet had entered the base of the back\r\nof his neck slightly to the right of the spine. It traveled downward\r\nand exited from the front of the neck, causing a nick in the left lower\r\nportion of the knot in the President\u2019s necktie. Before the shooting\r\nstarted, Governor Connally had been facing toward the crowd on the\r\nright. He started to turn toward the left and suddenly felt a blow on\r\nhis back. The Governor had been hit by a bullet which entered at the\r\nextreme right side of his back at a point below his right armpit. The\r\nbullet traveled through his chest in a downward and forward direction,\r\nexited below his right nipple, passed through his right wrist which had\r\nbeen in his lap, and then caused a wound to his left thigh. The force\r\nof the bullet\u2019s impact appeared to spin the Governor to his right, and\r\nMrs. Connally pulled him down into her lap. Another bullet then struck\r\nPresident Kennedy in the rear portion of his head, causing a massive\r\nand fatal wound. The President fell to the left into Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s lap.\r\n\r\nSecret Service Agent Clinton J. Hill, riding on the left running board\r\nof the \u201cfollowup\u201d car, heard a noise which sounded like a firecracker\r\nand saw the President suddenly lean forward and to the left. Hill\r\njumped off the car and raced toward the President\u2019s limousine. In the\r\nfront seat of the Vice-Presidential car, Agent Youngblood heard an\r\nexplosion and noticed unusual movements in the crowd. He vaulted into\r\nthe rear seat and sat on the Vice President in order to protect him.\r\nAt the same time Agent Kellerman in the front seat of the Presidential\r\nlimousine turned to observe the President. Seeing that the President\r\nwas struck, Kellerman instructed the driver, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here;\r\nwe are hit.\u201d He radioed ahead to the lead car, \u201cGet us to the hospital\r\nimmediately.\u201d Agent Greer immediately accelerated the Presidential car.\r\nAs it gained speed, Agent Hill managed to pull himself onto the back of\r\nthe car where Mrs. Kennedy had climbed. Hill pushed her back into the\r\nrear seat and shielded the stricken President and Mrs. Kennedy as the\r\nPresident\u2019s car proceeded at high speed to Parkland Memorial Hospital,\r\n4 miles away.", "start_char_idx": 52280, "end_char_idx": 56635, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2ecec0e-45a1-4f12-95b0-f6368a13c5e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2ecec0e-45a1-4f12-95b0-f6368a13c5e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "de549942-252e-4474-acd7-94026a234dbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "07696ed41af9d30f6e15d37c1a2f39dc669efd43775ef250e7664078d075e62c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4867a97a-67c3-4888-b1de-ba33b9097b0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "55b140591f70fd018bb0cfdbd5e91d297a2e6ffde88ed7595b37c29fef221f69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He vaulted into\r\nthe rear seat and sat on the Vice President in order to protect him.\r\nAt the same time Agent Kellerman in the front seat of the Presidential\r\nlimousine turned to observe the President.

The doctors noted irregular breathing\r\nmovements and a possible heartbeat, although they could not detect a\r\npulsebeat. They observed the extensive wound in the President\u2019s head\r\nand a small wound approximately one-fourth inch in diameter in the\r\nlower third of his neck. In an effort to facilitate breathing, the\r\nphysicians performed a tracheotomy by enlarging the throat wound and\r\ninserting a tube. Totally absorbed in the immediate task of trying to\r\npreserve the President\u2019s life, the attending doctors never turned the\r\nPresident over for an examination of his back. At 1 p.m., after all\r\nheart activity ceased and the Last Rites were administered by a priest,\r\nPresident Kennedy was pronounced dead. Governor Connally underwent\r\nsurgery and ultimately recovered from his serious wounds.\r\n\r\nUpon learning of the President\u2019s death, Vice President Johnson left\r\nParkland Hospital under close guard and proceeded to the Presidential\r\nplane at Love Field. Mrs. Kennedy, accompanying her husband\u2019s body,\r\nboarded the plane shortly thereafter. At 2:38 p.m., in the central\r\ncompartment of the plane, Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the 36th\r\nPresident of the United States by Federal District Court Judge Sarah T.\r\nHughes. The plane left immediately for Washington, D.C., arriving at\r\nAndrews AFB, Md., at 5:58 p.m., e.s.t. The President\u2019s body was taken\r\nto the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Md., where it was given\r\na complete pathological examination. The autopsy disclosed the large\r\nhead wound observed at Parkland and the wound in the front of the neck\r\nwhich had been enlarged by the Parkland doctors when they performed the\r\ntracheotomy. Both of these wounds were described in the autopsy report\r\nas being \u201cpresumably of exit.\u201d In addition the autopsy revealed a small\r\nwound of entry in the rear of the President\u2019s skull and another wound\r\nof entry near the base of the back of the neck. The autopsy report\r\nstated the cause of death as \u201cGunshot wound, head,\u201d and the bullets\r\nwhich struck the President were described as having been fired \u201cfrom a\r\npoint behind and somewhat above the level of the deceased.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the scene of the shooting, there was evident confusion at the\r\noutset concerning the point of origin of the shots. Witnesses differed\r\nin their accounts of the direction from which the sound of the shots\r\nemanated. Within a few minutes, however, attention centered on the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building as the source of the shots.\r\nThe building was occupied by a private corporation, the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Co., which distributed school textbooks of several\r\npublishers and leased space to representatives of the publishers. Most\r\nof the employees in the building worked for these publishers. The\r\nbalance, including a 15-man warehousing crew, were employees of the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Co. itself.\r\n\r\nSeveral eyewitnesses in front of the building reported that they saw a\r\nrifle being fired from the southeast corner window on the sixth floor\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository. One eyewitness, Howard L. Brennan,\r\nhad been watching the parade from a point on Elm Street directly\r\nopposite and facing the building. He promptly told a policeman that he\r\nhad seen a slender man, about 5 feet 10 inches, in his early thirties,\r\ntake deliberate aim from the sixth-floor corner window and fire a rifle\r\nin the direction of the President\u2019s car.", "start_char_idx": 55891, "end_char_idx": 60277, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4867a97a-67c3-4888-b1de-ba33b9097b0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4867a97a-67c3-4888-b1de-ba33b9097b0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b2ecec0e-45a1-4f12-95b0-f6368a13c5e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "cb724b3848005d9309093057aa2e4590195ee015d532ea03fac73370610a184a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3402c4d2-59c4-4502-8a55-967034a9f6a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f5f7ab7979f73f5611433d04a6469f15622fc021bab92a76d0bd4de1518dadd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The building was occupied by a private corporation, the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Co., which distributed school textbooks of several\r\npublishers and leased space to representatives of the publishers.

Brennan thought he might be\r\nable to identify the man since he had noticed him in the window a few\r\nminutes before the motorcade made the turn onto Elm Street. At 12:34\r\np.m., the Dallas police radio mentioned the Depository Building as\r\na possible source of the shots, and at 12:45 p.m., the police radio\r\nbroadcast a description of the suspected assassin based primarily on\r\nBrennan\u2019s observations.\r\n\r\nWhen the shots were fired, a Dallas motorcycle patrolman, Marrion L.\r\nBaker, was riding in the motorcade at a point several cars behind the\r\nPresident. He had turned right from Main Street onto Houston Street\r\nand was about 200 feet south of Elm Street when he heard a shot.\r\nBaker, having recently returned from a week of deer hunting, was\r\ncertain the shot came from a high-powered rifle. He looked up and saw\r\npigeons scattering in the air from their perches on the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Building. He raced his motorcycle to the building,\r\ndismounted, scanned the area to the west and pushed his way through the\r\nspectators toward the entrance. There he encountered Roy Truly, the\r\nbuilding superintendent, who offered Baker his help. They entered the\r\nbuilding, and ran toward the two elevators in the rear. Finding that\r\nboth elevators were on an upper floor, they dashed up the stairs. Not\r\nmore than 2 minutes had elapsed since the shooting.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the second-floor landing on their way up to the top\r\nof the building, Patrolman Baker thought he caught a glimpse of someone\r\nthrough the small glass window in the door separating the hall area\r\nnear the stairs from the small vestibule leading into the lunchroom.\r\nGun in hand, he rushed to the door and saw a man about 20 feet away\r\nwalking toward the other end of the lunchroom. The man was emptyhanded.\r\nAt Baker\u2019s command, the man turned and approached him. Truly, who had\r\nstarted up the stairs to the third floor ahead of Baker, returned\r\nto see what had delayed the patrolman. Baker asked Truly whether he\r\nknew the man in the lunchroom. Truly replied that the man worked in\r\nthe building, whereupon Baker turned from the man and proceeded, with\r\nTruly, up the stairs. The man they encountered had started working\r\nin the Texas School Book Depository Building on October 16, 1963. His\r\nfellow workers described him as very quiet--a \u201cloner.\u201d His name was Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nWithin about 1 minute after his encounter with Baker and Truly, Oswald\r\nwas seen passing through the second-floor offices. In his hand was a\r\nfull \u201cCoke\u201d bottle which he had purchased from a vending machine in\r\nthe lunchroom. He was walking toward the front of the building where\r\na passenger elevator and a short flight of stairs provided access to\r\nthe main entrance of the building on the first floor. Approximately 7\r\nminutes later, at about 12:40 p.m., Oswald boarded a bus at a point on\r\nElm Street seven short blocks east of the Depository Building.

Approximately 7\r\nminutes later, at about 12:40 p.m., Oswald boarded a bus at a point on\r\nElm Street seven short blocks east of the Depository Building. The bus\r\nwas traveling west toward the very building from which Oswald had come.\r\nIts route lay through the Oak Cliff section in southwest Dallas, where\r\nit would pass seven blocks east of the roominghouse in which Oswald was\r\nliving, at 1026 North Beckley Avenue. On the bus was Mrs. Mary Bledsoe,\r\none of Oswald\u2019s former landladies who immediately recognized him.\r\nOswald stayed on the bus approximately 3 or 4 minutes, during which\r\ntime it proceeded only two blocks because of the traffic jam created by\r\nthe motorcade and the assassination. Oswald then left the bus.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later he entered a vacant taxi four blocks away and asked\r\nthe driver to take him to a point on North Beckley Avenue several\r\nblocks beyond his roominghouse. The trip required 5 or 6 minutes. At\r\nabout 1 p.m. Oswald arrived at the roominghouse. The housekeeper, Mrs.\r\nEarlene Roberts, was surprised to see Oswald at midday and remarked\r\nto him that he seemed to be in quite a hurry. He made no reply. A few\r\nminutes later Oswald emerged from his room zipping up his jacket and\r\nrushed out of the house.\r\n\r\nApproximately 14 minutes later, and just 45 minutes after the\r\nassassination, another violent shooting occurred in Dallas. The victim\r\nwas Patrolman J.\u00a0D. Tippit of the Dallas police, an officer with a\r\ngood record during his more than 11 years with the police force. He\r\nwas shot near the intersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, about\r\nnine-tenths of a mile from Oswald\u2019s roominghouse. At the time of the\r\nassassination, Tippit was alone in his patrol car, the routine practice\r\nfor most police patrol cars at this time of day. He had been ordered by\r\nradio at 12:45 p.m. to proceed to the central Oak Cliff area as part of\r\na concentration of patrol car activity around the center of the city\r\nfollowing the assassination. At 12:54 Tippit radioed that he had moved\r\nas directed and would be available for any emergency. By this time the\r\npolice radio had broadcast several messages alerting the police to\r\nthe suspect described by Brennan at the scene of the assassination--a\r\nslender white male, about 30 years old, 5 feet 10 inches and weighing\r\nabout 165 pounds.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 1:15 p.m., Tippit was driving slowly in an easterly\r\ndirection on East 10th Street in Oak Cliff. About 100 feet past the\r\nintersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, Tippit pulled up\r\nalongside a man walking in the same direction. The man met the general\r\ndescription of the suspect wanted in connection with the assassination.\r\nHe walked over to Tippit\u2019s car, rested his arms on the door on the\r\nright-hand side of the car, and apparently exchanged words with Tippit\r\nthrough the window. Tippit opened the door on the left side and started\r\nto walk around the front of his car. As he reached the front wheel on\r\nthe driver\u2019s side, the man on the sidewalk drew a revolver and fired\r\nseveral shots in rapid succession, hitting Tippit four times and\r\nkilling him instantly. An automobile repairman, Domingo Benavides,\r\nheard the shots and stopped his pickup truck on the opposite side of\r\nthe street about 25 feet in front of Tippit\u2019s car. He observed the\r\ngunman start back toward Patton Avenue, removing the empty cartridge\r\ncases from the gun as he went. Benavides rushed to Tippit\u2019s side. The\r\npatrolman, apparently dead, was lying on his revolver, which was out\r\nof its holster. Benavides promptly reported the shooting to police\r\nheadquarters over the radio in Tippit\u2019s car. The message was received\r\nshortly after 1:16 p.m.\r\n\r\nAs the gunman left the scene, he walked hurriedly back toward Patton\r\nAvenue and turned left, heading south.", "start_char_idx": 62767, "end_char_idx": 66834, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e230cbe-caef-46fc-9d8c-a50a88d7b2a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e230cbe-caef-46fc-9d8c-a50a88d7b2a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3402c4d2-59c4-4502-8a55-967034a9f6a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "b9b6bc5d19b2dce4bf88dcf1f0cc7893dbe4915a2d999a0847cf6cf4bd0e3bb9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c74f6083-7d18-43e8-b565-03450f1bfa1b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1b5852454ae4e8f186399aec5356956e5ab47e8767ccd005b02183f2a1c13b1e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "An automobile repairman, Domingo Benavides,\r\nheard the shots and stopped his pickup truck on the opposite side of\r\nthe street about 25 feet in front of Tippit\u2019s car.

The message was received\r\nshortly after 1:16 p.m.\r\n\r\nAs the gunman left the scene, he walked hurriedly back toward Patton\r\nAvenue and turned left, heading south. Standing on the northwest corner\r\nof 10th Street and Patton Avenue was Helen Markham, who had been\r\nwalking south on Patton Avenue and had seen both the killer and Tippit\r\ncross the intersection in front of her as she waited on the curb for\r\ntraffic to pass. She witnessed the shooting and then saw the man with a\r\ngun in his hand walk back toward the corner and cut across the lawn of\r\nthe corner house as he started south on Patton Avenue.\r\n\r\nIn the corner house itself, Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis and her\r\nsister-in-law, Mrs. Virginia Davis, heard the shots and rushed to the\r\ndoor in time to see the man walk rapidly across the lawn shaking a\r\nrevolver as if he were emptying it of cartridge cases. Later that day\r\neach woman found a cartridge case near the house. As the gunman turned\r\nthe corner he passed alongside a taxicab which was parked on Patton\r\nAvenue, a few feet from 10th Street. The driver, William W. Scoggins,\r\nhad seen the slaying and was now crouched behind his cab on the street\r\nside. As the gunman cut through the shrubbery on the lawn, Scoggins\r\nlooked up and saw the man approximately 12 feet away. In his hand was a\r\npistol and he muttered words which sounded to Scoggins like \u201cpoor dumb\r\ncop\u201d or \u201cpoor damn cop.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter passing Scoggins, the gunman crossed to the west side of Patton\r\nAvenue and ran south toward Jefferson Boulevard, a main Oak Cliff\r\nthoroughfare. On the east side of Patton, between 10th Street and\r\nJefferson Boulevard, Ted Callaway, a used car salesman, heard the shots\r\nand ran to the sidewalk. As the man with the gun rushed past, Callaway\r\nshouted \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d The man merely shrugged, ran on to Jefferson\r\nBoulevard and turned right. On the next corner was a gas station with a\r\nparking lot in the rear. The assailant ran into the lot, discarded his\r\njacket and then continued his flight west on Jefferson.\r\n\r\nIn a shoe store a few blocks farther west on Jefferson, the manager,\r\nJohnny Calvin Brewer, heard the siren of a police car moments after\r\nthe radio in his store announced the shooting of the police officer in\r\nOak Cliff. Brewer saw a man step quickly into the entranceway of the\r\nstore and stand there with his back toward the street. When the police\r\ncar made a =U=-turn and headed back in the direction of the Tippit\r\nshooting, the man left and Brewer followed him. He saw the man enter\r\nthe Texas Theatre, a motion picture house about 60 feet away, without\r\nbuying a ticket. Brewer pointed this out to the cashier, Mrs. Julia\r\nPostal, who called the police. The time was shortly after 1:40 p.m.\r\n\r\nAt 1:29 p.m., the police radio had noted the similarity in the\r\ndescriptions of the suspects in the Tippit shooting and the\r\nassassination.

McDonald struck out with his right hand and\r\ngrabbed the gun with his left hand. After a brief struggle McDonald and\r\nseveral other police officers disarmed and handcuffed the suspect and\r\ndrove him to police headquarters, arriving at approximately 2 p.m.\r\n\r\nFollowing the assassination, police cars had rushed to the Texas School\r\nBook Depository in response to the many radio messages reporting that\r\nthe shots had been fired from the Depository Building. Inspector J.\r\nHerbert Sawyer of the Dallas Police Department arrived at the scene\r\nshortly after hearing the first of these police radio messages at 12:34\r\np.m. Some of the officers who had been assigned to the area of Elm\r\nand Houston Streets for the motorcade were talking to witnesses and\r\nwatching the building when Sawyer arrived. Sawyer entered the building\r\nand rode a passenger elevator to the fourth floor, which was the top\r\nfloor for this elevator. He conducted a quick search, returned to the\r\nmain floor and, between approximately 12:37 and 12:40 p.m., ordered\r\nthat no one be permitted to leave the building.\r\n\r\nShortly before 1 p.m. Capt. J. Will Fritz, chief of the homicide and\r\nrobbery bureau of the Dallas Police Department, arrived to take charge\r\nof the investigation. Searching the sixth floor, Deputy Sheriff Luke\r\nMooney noticed a pile of cartons in the southeast corner. He squeezed\r\nthrough the boxes and realized immediately that he had discovered the\r\npoint from which the shots had been fired. On the floor were three\r\nempty cartridge cases. A carton had apparently been placed on the floor\r\nat the side of the window so that a person sitting on the carton could\r\nlook down Elm Street toward the overpass and scarcely be noticed from\r\nthe outside. Between this carton and the half-open window were three\r\nadditional cartons arranged at such an angle that a rifle resting on\r\nthe top carton would be aimed directly at the motorcade as it moved\r\naway from the building. The high stack of boxes, which first attracted\r\nMooney\u2019s attention, effectively screened a person at the window from\r\nthe view of anyone else on the floor.\r\n\r\nMooney\u2019s discovery intensified the search for additional evidence on\r\nthe sixth floor, and at 1:22 p.m., approximately 10 minutes after the\r\ncartridge cases were found, Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone turned his\r\nflashlight in the direction of two rows of boxes in the northwest\r\ncorner near the staircase. Stuffed between the two rows was a\r\nbolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight. The rifle was not touched\r\nuntil it could be photographed. When Lt. J.\u00a0C. Day of the police\r\nidentification bureau decided that the wooden stock and the metal knob\r\nat the end of the bolt contained no prints, he held the rifle by the\r\nstock while Captain Fritz ejected a live shell by operating the bolt.\r\nLieutenant Day promptly noted that stamped on the rifle itself was the\r\nserial number \u201cC2766\u201d as well as the markings \u201c1940\u201d \u201cMADE ITALY\u201d and\r\n\u201cCAL. 6.5.\u201d The rifle was about 40 inches long and when disassembled it\r\ncould fit into a handmade paper sack which, after the assassination,\r\nwas found in the southeast corner of the building within a few feet of\r\nthe cartridge cases.\r\n\r\nAs Fritz and Day were completing their examination of this rifle on the\r\nsixth floor, Roy Truly, the building superintendent, approached with\r\ninformation which he felt should be brought to the attention of the\r\npolice. Earlier, while the police were questioning the employees, Truly\r\nhad observed that Lee Harvey Oswald, 1 of the 15 men who worked in the\r\nwarehouse, was missing.

The other was Robert Oswald, a full brother to\r\nLee and 5 years older. When Lee Oswald was 3, Mrs. Oswald placed him in\r\nan orphanage where his brother and half-brother were already living,\r\nprimarily because she had to work.\r\n\r\nIn January 1944, when Lee was 4, he was taken out of the orphanage, and\r\nshortly thereafter his mother moved with him to Dallas, Tex., where\r\nthe older boys joined them at the end of the school year. In May of\r\n1945 Marguerite Oswald married her third husband, Edwin A. Ekdahl.\r\nWhile the two older boys attended a military boarding school, Lee\r\nlived at home and developed a warm attachment to Ekdahl, occasionally\r\naccompanying his mother and stepfather on business trips around the\r\ncountry. Lee started school in Benbrook, Tex., but in the fall of\r\n1946, after a separation from Ekdahl, Marguerite Oswald reentered Lee\r\nin the first grade in Covington, La. In January 1947, while Lee was\r\nstill in the first grade, the family moved to Fort Worth, Tex., as the\r\nresult of an attempted reconciliation between Ekdahl and Lee\u2019s mother.\r\nA year and a half later, before Lee was 9, his mother was divorced\r\nfrom her third husband as the result of a divorce action instituted by\r\nEkdahl. Lee\u2019s school record during the next 5\u00bd years in Fort Worth was\r\naverage, although generally it grew poorer each year. The comments of\r\nteachers and others who knew him at that time do not reveal any unusual\r\npersonality traits or characteristics.\r\n\r\nAnother change for Lee Oswald occurred in August 1952, a few months\r\nafter he completed the sixth grade. Marguerite Oswald and her\r\n12-year-old son moved to New York City where Marguerite\u2019s oldest\r\nson, John Pic, was stationed with the Coast Guard. The ensuing year\r\nand one-half in New York was marked by Lee\u2019s refusals to attend\r\nschool and by emotional and psychological problems of a seemingly\r\nserious nature. Because he had become a chronic school truant, Lee\r\nunderwent psychiatric study at Youth House, an institution in New\r\nYork for juveniles who have had truancy problems or difficulties\r\nwith the law, and who appear to require psychiatric observation,\r\nor other types of guidance. The social worker assigned to his case\r\ndescribed him as \u201cseriously detached\u201d and \u201cwithdrawn\u201d and noted \u201ca\r\nrather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved,\r\naffectionless youngster.\u201d Lee expressed the feeling to the social\r\nworker that his mother did not care for him and regarded him as a\r\nburden.", "start_char_idx": 72894, "end_char_idx": 77146, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b221f88f-5a0d-4a48-b625-f4f82f823bbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "b221f88f-5a0d-4a48-b625-f4f82f823bbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "74c535c6-8cf6-45e2-9058-dcc3bda1e5fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "a1a4d3e71a761293d61249cc6b292262404cfb3a854c412d9c1de924a0494c30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8509d445-d3cf-41a4-aaaf-7e8747d6f560", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b79c3782b96880f42c58015e5dcbcc46291fb84c1b643759754e629298bc3881", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Marguerite Oswald and her\r\n12-year-old son moved to New York City where Marguerite\u2019s oldest\r\nson, John Pic, was stationed with the Coast Guard.

He experienced fantasies about being all powerful and hurting\r\npeople, but during his stay at Youth House he was apparently not\r\na behavior problem. He appeared withdrawn and evasive, a boy who\r\npreferred to spend his time alone, reading and watching television.\r\nHis tests indicated that he was above average in intelligence for\r\nhis age group. The chief psychiatrist of Youth House diagnosed Lee\u2019s\r\nproblem as a \u201cpersonality pattern disturbance with schizoid features\r\nand passive-aggressive tendencies.\u201d He concluded that the boy was \u201can\r\nemotionally, quite disturbed youngster\u201d and recommended psychiatric\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn May 1953, after having been at Youth House for 3 weeks, Lee Oswald\r\nreturned to school where his attendance and grades temporarily\r\nimproved. By the following fall, however, the probation officer\r\nreported that virtually every teacher complained about the boy\u2019s\r\nbehavior. His mother insisted that he did not need psychiatric\r\nassistance. Although there was apparently some improvement in Lee\u2019s\r\nbehavior during the next few months, the court recommended further\r\ntreatment. In January 1954, while Lee\u2019s case was still pending,\r\nMarguerite and Lee left for New Orleans, the city of Lee\u2019s birth.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to New Orleans, Lee maintained mediocre grades but\r\nhad no obvious behavior problems. Neighbors and others who knew him\r\noutside of school remembered him as a quiet, solitary and introverted\r\nboy who read a great deal and whose vocabulary made him quite\r\narticulate. About 1 month after he started the 10th grade and 11 days\r\nbefore his 16th birthday in October 1955, he brought to school a note\r\npurportedly written by his mother, stating that the family was moving\r\nto California. The note was written by Lee. A few days later he dropped\r\nout of school and almost immediately tried to join the Marine Corps.\r\nBecause he was only 16, he was rejected.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving school Lee worked for the next 10 months at several jobs\r\nin New Orleans as an office messenger or clerk. It was during this\r\nperiod that he started to read communist literature. Occasionally,\r\nin conversations with others, he praised communism and expressed to\r\nhis fellow employees a desire to join the Communist Party. At about\r\nthis time, when he was not yet 17, he wrote to the Socialist Party of\r\nAmerica, professing his belief in Marxism.\r\n\r\nAnother move followed in July 1956 when Lee and his mother returned\r\nto Fort Worth. He reentered high school but again dropped out after\r\na few weeks and enlisted in the Marine Corps on October 24, 1956, 6\r\ndays after his 17th birthday. On December 21, 1956, during boot camp\r\nin San Diego, Oswald fired a score of 212 for record with the M-1\r\nrifle--2 points over the minimum for a rating of \u201csharpshooter\u201d on a\r\nmarksman/sharpshooter/expert scale. After his basic training, Oswald\r\nreceived training in aviation fundamentals and then in radar scanning.\r\n\r\nMost people who knew Oswald in the Marines described him as a \u201cloner\u201d\r\nwho resented the exercise of authority by others. He spent much of\r\nhis free time reading. He was court-martialed once for possessing an\r\nunregistered privately owned weapon and, on another occasion, for using\r\nprovocative language to a noncommissioned officer. He was, however,\r\ngenerally able to comply with Marine discipline, even though his\r\nexperiences in the Marine Corps did not live up to his expectations.\r\n\r\nOswald served 15 months overseas until November 1958, most of it in\r\nJapan.", "start_char_idx": 76240, "end_char_idx": 80629, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8509d445-d3cf-41a4-aaaf-7e8747d6f560": {"__data__": {"id_": "8509d445-d3cf-41a4-aaaf-7e8747d6f560", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b221f88f-5a0d-4a48-b625-f4f82f823bbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "77db590b0be80623edcecb6a91c737f3ce8e5678d709c682fa422d31917663cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "720a76f3-84ab-4904-ac7f-f7a8e13e7b2d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "48b39f1a348cc91235082594693d59a7793c3c529dcaa85765ec14272d13ba18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "After his basic training, Oswald\r\nreceived training in aviation fundamentals and then in radar scanning.\r\n\r\nMost people who knew Oswald in the Marines described him as a \u201cloner\u201d\r\nwho resented the exercise of authority by others.

During his final year in the Marine Corps he was stationed for\r\nthe most part in Santa Ana, Calif., where he showed a marked interest\r\nin the Soviet Union and sometimes expressed politically radical views\r\nwith dogmatic conviction. Oswald again fired the M-1 rifle for record\r\non May 6, 1959, and this time he shot a score of 191 on a shorter\r\ncourse than before, only 1 point over the minimum required to be a\r\n\u201cmarksman.\u201d According to one of his fellow marines, Oswald was not\r\nparticularly interested in his rifle performance, and his unit was not\r\nexpected to exhibit the usual rifle proficiency. During this period\r\nhe expressed strong admiration for Fidel Castro and an interest in\r\njoining the Cuban army. He tried to impress those around him as an\r\nintellectual, but his thinking appeared to some as shallow and rigid.\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s Marine service terminated on September 11, 1959, when at his\r\nown request he was released from active service a few months ahead\r\nof his scheduled release. He offered as the reason for his release\r\nthe ill health and economic plight of his mother. He returned to Fort\r\nWorth, remained with his mother only 3 days and left for New Orleans,\r\ntelling his mother he planned to get work there in the shipping or\r\nimport-export business. In New Orleans he booked passage on the\r\nfreighter SS _Marion Lykes_, which sailed from New Orleans to Le Havre,\r\nFrance, on September 20, 1959.\r\n\r\nLee Harvey Oswald had presumably planned this step in his life for\r\nquite some time. In March of 1959 he had applied to the Albert\r\nSchweitzer College in Switzerland for admission to the spring 1960\r\nterm. His letter of application contained many blatant falsehoods\r\nconcerning his qualifications and background. A few weeks before his\r\ndischarge he had applied for and obtained a passport, listing the\r\nSoviet Union as one of the countries which he planned to visit. During\r\nhis service in the Marines he had saved a comparatively large sum of\r\nmoney, possibly as much as $1,500, which would appear to have been\r\naccomplished by considerable frugality and apparently for a specific\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accumulated fund soon became known. On October 16,\r\n1959, Oswald arrived in Moscow by train after crossing the border\r\nfrom Finland, where he had secured a visa for a 6-day stay in the\r\nSoviet Union. He immediately applied for Soviet citizenship. On the\r\nafternoon of October 21, 1959, Oswald was ordered to leave the Soviet\r\nUnion by 8 p.m. that evening. That same afternoon in his hotel room\r\nOswald, in an apparent suicide attempt, slashed his left wrist. He\r\nwas hospitalized immediately. On October 31, 3 days after his release\r\nfrom the hospital, Oswald appeared at the American Embassy, announced\r\nthat he wished to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a Russian\r\ncitizen, and handed the Embassy officer a written statement he had\r\nprepared for the occasion. When asked his reasons, Oswald replied, \u201cI\r\nam a Marxist.\u201d Oswald never formally complied with the legal steps\r\nnecessary to renounce his American citizenship. The Soviet Government\r\ndid not grant his request for citizenship, but in January 1960 he was\r\ngiven permission to remain in the Soviet Union on a year-to-year basis.\r\nAt the same time Oswald was sent to Minsk where he worked in a radio\r\nfactory as an unskilled laborer. In January 1961 his permission to\r\nremain in the Soviet Union was extended for another year. A few weeks\r\nlater, in February 1961, he wrote to the American Embassy in Moscow\r\nexpressing a desire to return to the United States.", "start_char_idx": 79957, "end_char_idx": 84190, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "720a76f3-84ab-4904-ac7f-f7a8e13e7b2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "720a76f3-84ab-4904-ac7f-f7a8e13e7b2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8509d445-d3cf-41a4-aaaf-7e8747d6f560", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "f08f9b92b599840d00b63bf755c50cba4cbdba7f8aa3ae9464e12be757fb2a40", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0d76b0d-5acf-4ee3-98e0-342e7d839556", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7be4f80cc9379cad49a15e37213e72988a5256931d07a06844cc945e13c5dfa0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "citizenship and become a Russian\r\ncitizen, and handed the Embassy officer a written statement he had\r\nprepared for the occasion.

A few weeks\r\nlater, in February 1961, he wrote to the American Embassy in Moscow\r\nexpressing a desire to return to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe following month Oswald met a 19-year-old Russian girl, Marina\r\nNikolaevna Prusakova, a pharmacist, who had been brought up in\r\nLeningrad but was then living with an aunt and uncle in Minsk. They\r\nwere married on April 30, 1961. Throughout the following year he\r\ncarried on a correspondence with American and Soviet authorities\r\nseeking approval for the departure of himself and his wife to the\r\nUnited States. In the course of this effort, Oswald and his wife\r\nvisited the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in July of 1961. Primarily on the\r\nbasis of an interview and questionnaire completed there, the Embassy\r\nconcluded that Oswald had not lost his citizenship, a decision\r\nsubsequently ratified by the Department of State in Washington, D.C.\r\nUpon their return to Minsk, Oswald and his wife filed with the Soviet\r\nauthorities for permission to leave together. Their formal application\r\nwas made in July 1961, and on December 25, 1961, Marina Oswald was\r\nadvised it would be granted.\r\n\r\nA daughter was born to the Oswalds in February 1962. In the months that\r\nfollowed they prepared for their return to the United States. On May 9,\r\n1962, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, at the request\r\nof the Department of State, agreed to waive a restriction under the\r\nlaw which would have prevented the issuance of a United States visa to\r\nOswald\u2019s Russian wife until she had left the Soviet Union. They finally\r\nleft Moscow on June 1, 1962, and were assisted in meeting their travel\r\nexpenses by a loan of $435.71 from the U.S. Department of State. Two\r\nweeks later they arrived in Fort Worth, Tex.\r\n\r\nFor a few weeks Oswald, his wife and child lived with Oswald\u2019s brother\r\nRobert. After a similar stay with Oswald\u2019s mother, they moved into\r\ntheir own apartment in early August. Oswald obtained a job on July\r\n16 as a sheet metal worker. During this period in Fort Worth, Oswald\r\nwas interviewed twice by agents of the FBI. The report of the first\r\ninterview, which occurred on June 26, described him as arrogant and\r\nunwilling to discuss the reasons why he had gone to the Soviet Union.\r\nOswald denied that he was involved in Soviet intelligence activities\r\nand promised to advise the FBI if Soviet representatives ever\r\ncommunicated with him. He was interviewed again on August 16, when he\r\ndisplayed a less belligerent attitude and once again agreed to inform\r\nthe FBI of any attempt to enlist him in intelligence activities.\r\n\r\nIn early October 1962 Oswald quit his job at the sheet metal plant\r\nand moved to Dallas. While living in Forth Worth the Oswalds had been\r\nintroduced to a group of Russian-speaking people in the Dallas-Fort\r\nWorth area. Many of them assisted the Oswalds by providing small\r\namounts of food, clothing, and household items. Oswald himself was\r\ndisliked by almost all of this group whose help to the family was\r\nprompted primarily by sympathy for Marina Oswald and the child.\r\nDespite the fact that he had left the Soviet Union, disillusioned\r\nwith its Government, Oswald seemed more firmly committed than ever to\r\nhis concepts of Marxism.

Oswald himself was\r\ndisliked by almost all of this group whose help to the family was\r\nprompted primarily by sympathy for Marina Oswald and the child.\r\nDespite the fact that he had left the Soviet Union, disillusioned\r\nwith its Government, Oswald seemed more firmly committed than ever to\r\nhis concepts of Marxism. He showed disdain for democracy, capitalism,\r\nand American society in general. He was highly critical of the\r\nRussian-speaking group because they seemed devoted to American concepts\r\nof democracy and capitalism and were ambitious to improve themselves\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\nIn February 1963 the Oswalds met Ruth Paine at a social gathering. Ruth\r\nPaine was temporarily separated from her husband and living with her\r\ntwo children in their home in Irving, Tex., a suburb of Dallas. Because\r\nof an interest in the Russian language and sympathy for Marina Oswald,\r\nwho spoke no English and had little funds, Ruth Paine befriended Marina\r\nand, during the next 2 months, visited her on several occasions.\r\n\r\nOn April 6, 1963, Oswald lost his job with a photography firm. A few\r\ndays later, on April 10, he attempted to kill Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n(Resigned, U.S. Army), using a rifle which he had ordered by mail 1\r\nmonth previously under an assumed name. Marina Oswald learned of her\r\nhusband\u2019s act when she confronted him with a note which he had left,\r\ngiving her instructions in the event he did not return. That incident\r\nand their general economic difficulties impelled Marina Oswald to\r\nsuggest that her husband leave Dallas and go to New Orleans to look for\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOswald left for New Orleans on April 24, 1963. Ruth Paine, who knew\r\nnothing of the Walker shooting, invited Marina Oswald and the baby to\r\nstay with her in the Paines\u2019 modest home while Oswald sought work in\r\nNew Orleans. Early in May, upon receiving word from Oswald that he had\r\nfound a job, Ruth Paine drove Marina Oswald and the baby to New Orleans\r\nto rejoin Oswald.\r\n\r\nDuring the stay in New Orleans, Oswald formed a fictitious New Orleans\r\nChapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He posed as secretary of\r\nthis organization and represented that the president was A.\u00a0J. Hidell.\r\nIn reality, Hidell was a completely fictitious person created by\r\nOswald, the organization\u2019s only member. Oswald was arrested on August 9\r\nin connection with a scuffle which occurred while he was distributing\r\npro-Castro leaflets. The next day, while at the police station, he\r\nwas interviewed by an FBI agent after Oswald requested the police to\r\narrange such an interview. Oswald gave the agent false information\r\nabout his own background and was evasive in his replies concerning Fair\r\nPlay for Cuba activities. During the next 2 weeks Oswald appeared on\r\nradio programs twice, claiming to be the spokesman for the Fair Play\r\nfor Cuba Committee in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nOn July 19, 1963, Oswald lost his job as a greaser of coffee processing\r\nmachinery. In September, after an exchange of correspondence with\r\nMarina Oswald, Ruth Paine drove to New Orleans and on September 23,\r\ntransported Marina, the child, and the family belongings to Irving,\r\nTex. Ruth Paine suggested that Marina Oswald, who was expecting her\r\nsecond child in October, live at the Paine house until after the baby\r\nwas born. Oswald remained behind, ostensibly to find work either in\r\nHouston or some other city. Instead, he departed by bus for Mexico,\r\narriving in Mexico City on September 27, where he promptly visited\r\nthe Cuban and Russian Embassies. His stated objective was to obtain\r\nofficial permission to visit Cuba, on his way to the Soviet Union. The\r\nCuban Government would not grant his visa unless the Soviet Government\r\nwould also issue a visa permitting his entry into Russia. Oswald\u2019s\r\nefforts to secure these visas failed, and he left for Dallas, where he\r\narrived on October 3, 1963.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw his wife the next day, it was decided that Oswald would\r\nrent a room in Dallas and visit his family on weekends.

For 1 week he\r\nrented a room from Mrs. Bledsoe, the woman who later saw him on the bus\r\nshortly after the assassination. On October 14, 1963, he rented the\r\nBeckley Avenue room and listed his name as O.\u00a0H. Lee. On the same day,\r\nat the suggestion of a neighbor, Mrs. Paine phoned the Texas School\r\nBook Depository and was told that there was a job opening. She informed\r\nOswald who was interviewed the following day at the Depository and\r\nstarted to work there on October 16, 1963.\r\n\r\nOn October 20 the Oswalds\u2019 second daughter was born. During October\r\nand November Oswald established a general pattern of weekend visits to\r\nIrving, arriving on Friday afternoon and returning to Dallas Monday\r\nmorning with a fellow employee, Buell Wesley Frazier, who lived near\r\nthe Paines. On Friday, November 15, Oswald remained in Dallas at the\r\nsuggestion of his wife who told him that the house would be crowded\r\nbecause of a birthday party for Ruth Paine\u2019s daughter. On Monday,\r\nNovember 18, Oswald and his wife quarreled bitterly during a telephone\r\nconversation, because she learned for the first time that he was living\r\nat the roominghouse under an assumed name. On Thursday, November 21,\r\nOswald told Frazier that he would like to drive to Irving to pick up\r\nsome curtain rods for an apartment in Dallas. His wife and Mrs. Paine\r\nwere quite surprised to see him since it was a Thursday night. They\r\nthought he had returned to make up after Monday\u2019s quarrel. He was\r\nconciliatory, but Marina Oswald was still angry.\r\n\r\nLater that evening, when Mrs. Paine had finished cleaning the kitchen,\r\nshe went into the garage and noticed that the light was burning. She\r\nwas certain that she had not left it on, although the incident appeared\r\nunimportant at the time. In the garage were most of the Oswalds\u2019\r\npersonal possessions. The following morning Oswald left while his wife\r\nwas still in bed feeding the baby. She did not see him leave the house,\r\nnor did Ruth Paine. On the dresser in their room he left his wedding\r\nring which he had never done before. His wallet containing $170 was\r\nleft intact in a dresser-drawer.\r\n\r\nOswald walked to Frazier\u2019s house about half a block away and placed a\r\nlong bulky package, made out of wrapping paper and tape, into the rear\r\nseat of the car. He told Frazier that the package contained curtain\r\nrods. When they reached the Depository parking lot, Oswald walked\r\nquickly ahead. Frazier followed and saw Oswald enter the Depository\r\nBuilding carrying the long bulky package with him.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning of November 22, Marina Oswald followed President\r\nKennedy\u2019s activities on television. She and Ruth Paine cried when they\r\nheard that the President had been shot. Ruth Paine translated the news\r\nof the shooting to Marina Oswald as it came over television, including\r\nthe report that the shots were probably fired from the building where\r\nOswald worked. When Marina Oswald heard this, she recalled the Walker\r\nepisode and the fact that her husband still owned the rifle. She went\r\nquietly to the Paine\u2019s garage where the rifle had been concealed in a\r\nblanket among their other belongings.

Soon after the start of the first interrogation, agents of\r\nthe FBI and the U.S. Secret Service arrived and participated in the\r\nquestioning. Oswald denied having anything to do with the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy or the murder of Patrolman Tippit. He claimed that\r\nhe was eating lunch at the time of the assassination, and that he then\r\nspoke with his foreman for 5 to 10 minutes before going home. He denied\r\nthat he owned a rifle and when confronted, in a subsequent interview,\r\nwith a picture showing him holding a rifle and pistol, he claimed that\r\nhis face had been superimposed on someone else\u2019s body. He refused to\r\nanswer any questions about the presence in his wallet of a selective\r\nservice card with his picture and the name \u201cAlek J. Hidell.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the questioning of Oswald on the third floor of the police\r\ndepartment, more than 100 representatives of the press, radio, and\r\ntelevision were crowded into the hallway through which Oswald had\r\nto pass when being taken from his cell to Captain Fritz\u2019 office for\r\ninterrogation. Reporters tried to interview Oswald during these\r\ntrips. Between Friday afternoon and Sunday morning he appeared in the\r\nhallway at least 16 times. The generally confused conditions outside\r\nand inside Captain Fritz\u2019 office increased the difficulty of police\r\nquestioning. Advised by the police that he could communicate with an\r\nattorney, Oswald made several telephone calls on Saturday in an effort\r\nto procure representation of his own choice and discussed the matter\r\nwith the president of the local bar association, who offered to obtain\r\ncounsel. Oswald declined the offer saying that he would first try to\r\nobtain counsel by himself. By Sunday morning he had not yet engaged an\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\nAt 7:10 p.m. on November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald was formally\r\nadvised that he had been charged with the murder of Patrolman J.D.\r\nTippit. Several witnesses to the Tippit slaying and to the subsequent\r\nflight of the gunman had positively identified Oswald in police\r\nlineups. While positive firearm identification evidence was not\r\navailable at the time, the revolver in Oswald\u2019s possession at the time\r\nof his arrest was of a type which could have fired the shots that\r\nkilled Tippit.\r\n\r\nThe formal charge against Oswald for the assassination of President\r\nKennedy was lodged shortly after 1:30 a.m., on Saturday, November 23.\r\nBy 10 p.m. of the day of the assassination, the FBI had traced the\r\nrifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository to\r\na mailorder house in Chicago which had purchased it from a distributor\r\nin New York. Approximately 6 hours later the Chicago firm advised\r\nthat this rifle had been ordered in March 1963 by an A. Hidel for\r\nshipment to post office box 2915, in Dallas, Tex., a box rented by\r\nOswald. Payment for the rifle was remitted by a money order signed by\r\nA. Hidell. By 6:45 p.m. on November 23, the FBI was able to advise\r\nthe Dallas police that, as a result of handwriting analysis of the\r\ndocuments used to purchase the rifle, it had concluded that the rifle\r\nhad been ordered by Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nThroughout Friday and Saturday, the Dallas police released to the\r\npublic many of the details concerning the alleged evidence against\r\nOswald.

Police officials discussed important aspects of the case,\r\nusually in the course of impromptu and confused press conferences\r\nin the third-floor corridor. Some of the information divulged was\r\nerroneous. Efforts by the news media representatives to reconstruct the\r\ncrime and promptly report details frequently led to erroneous and often\r\nconflicting reports. At the urgings of the newsmen, Chief of Police\r\nJesse E. Curry, brought Oswald to a press conference in the police\r\nassembly room shortly after midnight of the day Oswald was arrested.\r\nThe assembly room was crowded with newsmen who had come to Dallas from\r\nall over the country. They shouted questions at Oswald and flashed\r\ncameras at him. Among this group was a 52-year-old Dallas nightclub\r\noperator--Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, November 24, arrangements were made for Oswald\u2019s\r\ntransfer from the city jail to the Dallas County jail, about 1 mile\r\naway. The news media had been informed on Saturday night that the\r\ntransfer of Oswald would not take place until after 10 a.m. on Sunday.\r\nEarlier on Sunday, between 2:30 and 3 a.m., anonymous telephone calls\r\nthreatening Oswald\u2019s life had been received by the Dallas office of the\r\nFBI and by the office of the county sheriff. Nevertheless, on Sunday\r\nmorning, television, radio, and newspaper representatives crowded into\r\nthe basement to record the transfer. As viewed through television\r\ncameras, Oswald would emerge from a door in front of the cameras and\r\nproceed to the transfer vehicle. To the right of the cameras was a\r\n\u201cdown\u201d ramp from Main Street on the north. To the left was an \u201cup\u201d ramp\r\nleading to Commerce Street on the south.\r\n\r\nThe armored truck in which Oswald was to be transferred arrived shortly\r\nafter 11 a.m. Police officials then decided, however, that an unmarked\r\npolice car would be preferable for the trip because of its greater\r\nspeed and maneuverability. At approximately 11:20 a.m. Oswald emerged\r\nfrom the basement jail office flanked by detectives on either side and\r\nat his rear. He took a few steps toward the car and was in the glaring\r\nlight of the television cameras when a man suddenly darted out from\r\nan area on the right of the cameras where newsmen had been assembled.\r\nThe man was carrying a Colt .38 revolver in his right hand and, while\r\nmillions watched on television, he moved quickly to within a few feet\r\nof Oswald and fired one shot into Oswald\u2019s abdomen. Oswald groaned with\r\npain as he fell to the ground and quickly lost consciousness. Within 7\r\nminutes Oswald was at Parkland Hospital where, without having regained\r\nconsciousness, he was pronounced dead at 1:07 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe man who killed Oswald was Jack Ruby. He was instantly arrested and,\r\nminutes later, confined in a cell on the fifth floor of the Dallas\r\npolice jail. Under interrogation, he denied that the killing of Oswald\r\nwas in any way connected with a conspiracy involving the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy. He maintained that he had killed Oswald in a\r\ntemporary fit of depression and rage over the President\u2019s death. Ruby\r\nwas transferred the following day to the county jail without notice to\r\nthe press or to police officers not directly involved in the transfer.\r\nIndicted for the murder of Oswald by the State of Texas on November 26,\r\n1963, Ruby was found guilty on March 14, 1964, and sentenced to death.\r\nAs of September 1964, his case was pending on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThis Commission was created to ascertain the facts relating to the\r\npreceding summary of events and to consider the important questions\r\nwhich they raised.

The Commission has addressed itself to this task and\r\nhas reached certain conclusions based on all the available evidence.\r\nNo limitations have been placed on the Commission\u2019s inquiry; it has\r\nconducted its own investigation, and all Government agencies have fully\r\ndischarged their responsibility to cooperate with the Commission in its\r\ninvestigation. These conclusions represent the reasoned judgment of\r\nall members of the Commission and are presented after an investigation\r\nwhich has satisfied the Commission that it has ascertained the truth\r\nconcerning the assassination of President Kennedy to the extent that a\r\nprolonged and thorough search makes this possible.\r\n\r\n1. The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor\r\nConnally were fired from the sixth floor window at the southeast corner\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository. This determination is based upon\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Witnesses at the scene of the assassination saw a rifle\r\n    being fired from the sixth floor window of the Depository\r\n    Building, and some witnesses saw a rifle in the window\r\n    immediately after the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The nearly whole bullet found on Governor Connally\u2019s\r\n    stretcher at Parkland Memorial Hospital and the two bullet\r\n    fragments found in the front seat of the Presidential limousine\r\n    were fired from the 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano rifle\r\n    found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building to the\r\n    exclusion of all other weapons.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The three used cartridge cases found near the window on\r\n    the sixth floor at the southeast corner of the building were\r\n    fired from the same rifle which fired the above-described\r\n    bullet and fragments, to the exclusion of all other weapons.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The windshield in the Presidential limousine was struck\r\n    by a bullet fragment on the inside surface of the glass, but\r\n    was not penetrated.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) The nature of the bullet wounds suffered by President\r\n    Kennedy and Governor Connally and the location of the car at\r\n    the time of the shots establish that the bullets were fired\r\n    from above and behind the Presidential limousine, striking the\r\n    President and the Governor as follows:\r\n\r\n    (1) President Kennedy was first struck by a bullet which\r\n    entered at the back of his neck and exited through the lower\r\n    front portion of his neck, causing a wound which would not\r\n    necessarily have been lethal. The President was struck a second\r\n    time by a bullet which entered the right-rear portion of his\r\n    head, causing a massive and fatal wound.\r\n\r\n    (2) Governor Connally was struck by a bullet which entered on\r\n    the right side of his back and traveled downward through the\r\n    right side of his chest, exiting below his right nipple. This\r\n    bullet then passed through his right wrist and entered his left\r\n    thigh where it caused a superficial wound.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) There is no credible evidence that the shots were fired\r\n    from the Triple Underpass, ahead of the motorcade, or from any\r\n    other location.\r\n\r\n2. The weight of the evidence indicates that there were three shots\r\nfired.\r\n\r\n3. Although it is not necessary to any essential findings of the\r\nCommission to determine just which shot hit Governor Connally, there\r\nis very persuasive evidence from the experts to indicate that the\r\nsame bullet which pierced the President\u2019s throat also caused Governor\r\nConnally\u2019s wounds. However, Governor Connally\u2019s testimony and certain\r\nother factors have given rise to some difference of opinion as to this\r\nprobability but there is no question in the mind of any member of the\r\nCommission that all the shots which caused the President\u2019s and Governor\r\nConnally\u2019s wounds were fired from the sixth floor window of the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository.\r\n\r\n4. The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor\r\nConnally were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald.", "start_char_idx": 100616, "end_char_idx": 105342, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a4714e4-8334-48fd-94f8-a64ec42e16ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a4714e4-8334-48fd-94f8-a64ec42e16ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ec9f28f-fc3d-407c-979d-b56320d8fd5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "6db86fde60928c2945f3ab6f6a7928bff29540845b8e923e5d98fb3e9d738f46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4b99e23-a739-486c-b752-348b5a78a953", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c9e502a2a25e18177c97392a2fff4a21450d559acc14e78d9f29bda8d9a4380", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "2.

The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor\r\nConnally were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald. This conclusion is based upon\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle from\r\n    which the shots were fired was owned by and in the possession\r\n    of Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Oswald carried this rifle into the Depository Building on\r\n    the morning of November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Oswald, at the time of the assassination, was present at\r\n    the window from which the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Shortly after the assassination, the Mannlicher-Carcano\r\n    rifle belonging to Oswald was found partially hidden between\r\n    some cartons on the sixth floor and the improvised paper bag\r\n    in which Oswald brought the rifle to the Depository was found\r\n    close by the window from which the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) Based on testimony of the experts and their analysis of\r\n    films of the assassination, the Commission has concluded that a\r\n    rifleman of Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s capabilities could have fired\r\n    the shots from the rifle used in the assassination within the\r\n    elapsed time of the shooting. The Commission has concluded\r\n    further that Oswald possessed the capability with a rifle\r\n    which enabled him to commit the assassination.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) Oswald lied to the police after his arrest concerning\r\n    important substantive matters.\r\n\r\n    (_g_) Oswald had attempted to kill Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n    (Resigned, U.\u00a0S. Army) on April 10, 1963, thereby demonstrating\r\n    his disposition to take human life.\r\n\r\n5. Oswald killed Dallas Police Patrolman J.\u00a0D. Tippit approximately 45\r\nminutes after the assassination. This conclusion upholds the finding\r\nthat Oswald fired the shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded\r\nGovernor Connally and is supported by the following:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Two eyewitnesses saw the Tippit shooting and seven\r\n    eyewitnesses heard the shots and saw the gunman leave the scene\r\n    with revolver in hand. These nine eyewitnesses positively\r\n    identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The cartridge cases found at the scene of the shooting\r\n    were fired from the revolver in the possession of Oswald at the\r\n    time of his arrest to the exclusion of all other weapons.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The revolver in Oswald\u2019s possession at the time of his\r\n    arrest was purchased by and belonged to Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Oswald\u2019s jacket was found along the path of flight taken\r\n    by the gunman as he fled from the scene of the killing.\r\n\r\n6. Within 80 minutes of the assassination and 35 minutes of the Tippit\r\nkilling Oswald resisted arrest at the theatre by attempting to shoot\r\nanother Dallas police officer.\r\n\r\n7. The Commission has reached the following conclusions concerning\r\nOswald\u2019s interrogation and detention by the Dallas police:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Except for the force required to effect his arrest,\r\n    Oswald was not subjected to any physical coercion by any law\r\n    enforcement officials. He was advised that he could not be\r\n    compelled to give any information and that any statements made\r\n    by him might be used against him in court. He was advised of\r\n    his right to counsel. He was given the opportunity to obtain\r\n    counsel of his own choice and was offered legal assistance by\r\n    the Dallas Bar Association, which he rejected at that time.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Newspaper, radio, and television reporters were allowed\r\n    uninhibited access to the area through which Oswald had to\r\n    pass when he was moved from his cell to the interrogation room\r\n    and other sections of the building, thereby subjecting Oswald\r\n    to harassment and creating chaotic conditions which were not\r\n    conducive to orderly interrogation or the protection of the\r\n    rights of the prisoner.", "start_char_idx": 104497, "end_char_idx": 109062, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4b99e23-a739-486c-b752-348b5a78a953": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4b99e23-a739-486c-b752-348b5a78a953", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a4714e4-8334-48fd-94f8-a64ec42e16ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "93156149e49ca387171e21ba6e55b155c65a9a99fea813cc0765d1cac6550d77", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "46c980a1-596e-4ca6-9f4f-f912e185df56", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9101f5b8e858a4aedec050bdaf1b10bb5c61eff0e1e8ea9c53c9dc2e2028f07a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He was advised that he could not be\r\n    compelled to give any information and that any statements made\r\n    by him might be used against him in court.

To the extent that the information\r\n    was erroneous or misleading, it helped to create doubts,\r\n    speculations, and fears in the mind of the public which might\r\n    otherwise not have arisen.\r\n\r\n8. The Commission has reached the following conclusions concerning the\r\nkilling of Oswald by Jack Ruby on November 24, 1963:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Ruby entered the basement of the Dallas Police Department\r\n    shortly after 11:17 a.m. and killed Lee Harvey Oswald at 11:21\r\n    a.m.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Although the evidence on Ruby\u2019s means of entry is not\r\n    conclusive, the weight of the evidence indicates that he walked\r\n    down the ramp leading from Main Street to the basement of the\r\n    police department.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) There is no evidence to support the rumor that Ruby\r\n    may have been assisted by any members of the Dallas Police\r\n    Department in the killing of Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The Dallas Police Department\u2019s decision to transfer\r\n    Oswald to the county jail in full public view was unsound.\r\n    The arrangements made by the police department on Sunday\r\n    morning, only a few hours before the attempted transfer, were\r\n    inadequate. Of critical importance was the fact that news media\r\n    representatives and others were not excluded from the basement\r\n    even after the police were notified of threats to Oswald\u2019s\r\n    life. These deficiencies contributed to the death of Lee Harvey\r\n    Oswald.\r\n\r\n9. The Commission has found no evidence that either Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nor Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign, to\r\nassassinate President Kennedy. The reasons for this conclusion are:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Commission has found no evidence that anyone assisted\r\n    Oswald in planning or carrying out the assassination. In this\r\n    connection it has thoroughly investigated, among other factors,\r\n    the circumstances surrounding the planning of the motorcade\r\n    route through Dallas, the hiring of Oswald by the Texas School\r\n    Book Depository Co. on October 15, 1963, the method by which\r\n    the rifle was brought into the building, the placing of cartons\r\n    of books at the window, Oswald\u2019s escape from the building, and\r\n    the testimony of eyewitnesses to the shooting.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The Commission has found no evidence that Oswald\r\n    was involved with any person or group in a conspiracy to\r\n    assassinate the President, although it has thoroughly\r\n    investigated, in addition to other possible leads, all facets\r\n    of Oswald\u2019s associations, finances, and personal habits,\r\n    particularly during the period following his return from the\r\n    Soviet Union in June 1962.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The Commission has found no evidence to show that\r\n    Oswald was employed, persuaded, or encouraged by any foreign\r\n    government to assassinate President Kennedy or that he was an\r\n    agent of any foreign government, although the Commission has\r\n    reviewed the circumstances surrounding Oswald\u2019s defection to\r\n    the Soviet Union, his life there from October of 1959 to June\r\n    of 1962 so far as it can be reconstructed, his known contacts\r\n    with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and his visits to the\r\n    Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City during his trip to\r\n    Mexico from September 26 to October 3, 1963, and his known\r\n    contacts with the Soviet Embassy in the United States.", "start_char_idx": 108267, "end_char_idx": 112698, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}:

The Commission has found no evidence to show that\r\n    Oswald was employed, persuaded, or encouraged by any foreign\r\n    government to assassinate President Kennedy or that he was an\r\n    agent of any foreign government, although the Commission has\r\n    reviewed the circumstances surrounding Oswald\u2019s defection to\r\n    the Soviet Union, his life there from October of 1959 to June\r\n    of 1962 so far as it can be reconstructed, his known contacts\r\n    with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and his visits to the\r\n    Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City during his trip to\r\n    Mexico from September 26 to October 3, 1963, and his known\r\n    contacts with the Soviet Embassy in the United States.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The Commission has explored all attempts of Oswald to\r\n    identify himself with various political groups, including the\r\n    Communist Party, U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A., the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,\r\n    and the Socialist Workers Party, and has been unable to find\r\n    any evidence that the contacts which he initiated were related\r\n    to Oswald\u2019s subsequent assassination of the President.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) All of the evidence before the Commission established\r\n    that there was nothing to support the speculation that Oswald\r\n    was an agent, employee, or informant of the FBI, the CIA, or\r\n    any other governmental agency. It has thoroughly investigated\r\n    Oswald\u2019s relationships prior to the assassination with all\r\n    agencies of the U.\u00a0S. Government. All contacts with Oswald by\r\n    any of these agencies were made in the regular exercise of\r\n    their different responsibilities.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) No direct or indirect relationship between Lee Harvey\r\n    Oswald and Jack Ruby has been discovered by the Commission, nor\r\n    has it been able to find any credible evidence that either knew\r\n    the other, although a thorough investigation was made of the\r\n    many rumors and speculations of such a relationship.\r\n\r\n    (_g_) The Commission has found no evidence that Jack Ruby acted\r\n    with any other person in the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_h_) After careful investigation the Commission has found no\r\n    credible evidence either that Ruby and Officer Tippit, who was\r\n    killed by Oswald, knew each other or that Oswald and Tippit\r\n    knew each other.\r\n\r\n    Because of the difficulty of proving negatives to a certainty\r\n    the possibility of others being involved with either Oswald\r\n    or Ruby cannot be established categorically, but if there is\r\n    any such evidence it has been beyond the reach of all the\r\n    investigative agencies and resources of the United States and\r\n    has not come to the attention of this Commission.\r\n\r\n10. In its entire investigation the Commission has found no evidence of\r\nconspiracy, subversion, or disloyalty to the U.\u00a0S. Government by any\r\nFederal, State, or local official.\r\n\r\n11. On the basis of the evidence before the Commission it concludes\r\nthat Oswald acted alone. Therefore, to determine the motives for the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy, one must look to the assassin\r\nhimself. Clues to Oswald\u2019s motives can be found in his family\r\nhistory, his education or lack of it, his acts, his writings, and the\r\nrecollections of those who had close contacts with him throughout\r\nhis life. The Commission has presented with this report all of the\r\nbackground information bearing on motivation which it could discover.\r\nThus, others may study Lee Oswald\u2019s life and arrive at their own\r\nconclusions as to his possible motives.\r\n\r\nThe Commission could not make any definitive determination of Oswald\u2019s\r\nmotives. It has endeavored to isolate factors which contributed to his\r\ncharacter and which might have influenced his decision to assassinate\r\nPresident Kennedy. These factors were:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) His deep-rooted resentment of all authority which was\r\n    expressed in a hostility toward every society in which he lived;\r\n\r\n    (_b_) His inability to enter into meaningful relationships with\r\n    people, and a continuous pattern of rejecting his environment\r\n    in favor of new surroundings;\r\n\r\n    (_c_) His urge to try to find a place in history and despair at\r\n    times over failures in his various undertakings;\r\n\r\n    (_d_) His capacity for violence as evidenced by his attempt to\r\n    kill General Walker;\r\n\r\n    (_e_) His avowed commitment to Marxism and communism, as he\r\n    understood the terms and developed his own interpretation of\r\n    them; this was expressed by his antagonism toward the United\r\n    States, by his defection to the Soviet Union, by his failure\r\n    to be reconciled with life in the United States even after\r\n    his disenchantment with the Soviet Union, and by his efforts,\r\n    though frustrated, to go to Cuba.", "start_char_idx": 111988, "end_char_idx": 116725, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47cbd1c4-d911-439c-b3b8-1c8214bd432a": {"__data__": {"id_": "47cbd1c4-d911-439c-b3b8-1c8214bd432a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "46c980a1-596e-4ca6-9f4f-f912e185df56", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "71d972ad1265241307ab20b4f2479beb4e476728ec97dcf028029ae1f8d73049", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dcef4f57-20e1-406e-98b0-6d343184fe47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fa5180c76ad38f7ac1a0bb346c6e335d775b4ba12e0e3b8c4c64b49b70986084", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Each of these contributed to his capacity to risk all in cruel and\r\nirresponsible actions.\r\n\r\n12. The Commission recognizes that the varied responsibilities of the\r\nPresident require that he make frequent trips to all parts of the\r\nUnited States and abroad. Consistent with their high responsibilities\r\nPresidents can never be protected from every potential threat. The\r\nSecret Service\u2019s difficulty in meeting its protective responsibility\r\nvaries with the activities and the nature of the occupant of the\r\nOffice of President and his willingness to conform to plans for his\r\nsafety. In appraising the performance of the Secret Service it should\r\nbe understood that it has to do its work within such limitations.\r\nNevertheless, the Commission believes that recommendations for\r\nimprovements in Presidential protection are compelled by the facts\r\ndisclosed in this investigation.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The complexities of the Presidency have increased so\r\n    rapidly in recent years that the Secret Service has not been\r\n    able to develop or to secure adequate resources of personnel\r\n    and facilities to fulfill its important assignment. This\r\n    situation should be promptly remedied.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The Commission has concluded that the criteria and\r\n    procedures of the Secret Service designed to identify and\r\n    protect against persons considered threats to the president,\r\n    were not adequate prior to the assassination.\r\n\r\n    (1) The Protective Research Section of the Secret Service,\r\n    which is responsible for its preventive work, lacked sufficient\r\n    trained personnel and the mechanical and technical assistance\r\n    needed to fulfill its responsibility.\r\n\r\n    (2) Prior to the assassination the Secret Service\u2019s criteria\r\n    dealt with direct threats against the President. Although the\r\n    Secret Service treated the direct threats against the President\r\n    adequately, it failed to recognize the necessity of identifying\r\n    other potential sources of danger to his security. The Secret\r\n    Service did not develop adequate and specific criteria defining\r\n    those persons or groups who might present a danger to the\r\n    President. In effect, the Secret Service largely relied upon\r\n    other Federal or State agencies to supply the information\r\n    necessary for it to fulfill its preventive responsibilities,\r\n    although it did ask for information about direct threats to the\r\n    President.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The Commission has concluded that there was insufficient\r\n    liaison and coordination of information between the Secret\r\n    Service and other Federal agencies necessarily concerned with\r\n    Presidential protection. Although the FBI, in the normal\r\n    exercise of its responsibility, had secured considerable\r\n    information about Lee Harvey Oswald, it had no official\r\n    responsibility, under the Secret Service criteria existing\r\n    at the time of the President\u2019s trip to Dallas, to refer to\r\n    the Secret Service the information it had about Oswald. The\r\n    Commission has concluded, however, that the FBI took an unduly\r\n    restrictive view of its role in preventive intelligence work\r\n    prior to the assassination. A more carefully coordinated\r\n    treatment of the Oswald case by the FBI might well have\r\n    resulted in bringing Oswald\u2019s activities to the attention of\r\n    the Secret Service.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The Commission has concluded that some of the advance\r\n    preparations in Dallas made by the Secret Service, such as the\r\n    detailed security measures taken at Love Field and the Trade\r\n    Mart, were thorough and well executed. In other respects,\r\n    however, the Commission has concluded that the advance\r\n    preparations for the President\u2019s trip were deficient.\r\n\r\n    (1) Although the Secret Service is compelled to rely to a great\r\n    extent on local law enforcement officials, its procedures at\r\n    the time of the Dallas trip did not call for well-defined\r\n    instructions as to the respective responsibilities of the\r\n    police officials and others assisting in the protection of the\r\n    President.\r\n\r\n    (2) The procedures relied upon by the Secret Service for\r\n    detecting the presence of an assassin located in a building\r\n    along a motorcade route were inadequate. At the time of the\r\n    trip to Dallas, the Secret Service as a matter of practice did\r\n    not investigate, or cause to be checked, any building located\r\n    along the motorcade route to be taken by the President. The\r\n    responsibility for observing windows in these buildings during\r\n    the motorcade was divided between local police personnel\r\n    stationed on the streets to regulate crowds and Secret Service\r\n    agents riding in the motorcade. Based on its investigation the\r\n    Commission has concluded that these arrangements during the\r\n    trip to Dallas were clearly not sufficient.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) The configuration of the Presidential car and the seating\r\n    arrangements of the Secret Service agents in the car did not\r\n    afford the Secret Service agents the opportunity they should\r\n    have had to be of immediate assistance to the President at the\r\n    first sign of danger.", "start_char_idx": 116729, "end_char_idx": 121881, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dcef4f57-20e1-406e-98b0-6d343184fe47": {"__data__": {"id_": "dcef4f57-20e1-406e-98b0-6d343184fe47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "47cbd1c4-d911-439c-b3b8-1c8214bd432a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "0f6d773ba2e5c04ecf8737ba56ba99b28ee1bea185d64feca34b2700b068f635", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb15121a-efaa-4919-9952-9dd11573f8fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4098b37725adab604742c76c572b7e962b4b6abdc3343435dab268b1078c7067", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "At the time of the\r\n    trip to Dallas, the Secret Service as a matter of practice did\r\n    not investigate, or cause to be checked, any building located\r\n    along the motorcade route to be taken by the President.

As a result of studies conducted during the past several\r\nmonths, and in cooperation with this Commission, the Secret Service has\r\nprepared a planning document dated August 27, 1964, which recommends\r\nvarious programs considered necessary by the Service to improve its\r\ntechniques and enlarge its resources. The Commission is encouraged by\r\nthe efforts taken by the Secret Service since the assassination and\r\nsuggests the following recommendations.\r\n\r\n1. A committee of Cabinet members including the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury and the Attorney General, or the National Security Council,\r\nshould be assigned the responsibility of reviewing and overseeing the\r\nprotective activities of the Secret Service and the other Federal\r\nagencies that assist in safeguarding the President. Once given this\r\nresponsibility, such a committee would insure that the maximum\r\nresources of the Federal Government are fully engaged in the task of\r\nprotecting the President, and would provide guidance in defining the\r\ngeneral nature of domestic and foreign dangers to Presidential security.\r\n\r\n2. Suggestions have been advanced to the Commission for the transfer\r\nof all or parts of the Presidential protective responsibilities of\r\nthe Secret Service to some other department or agency. The Commission\r\nbelieves that if there is to be any determination of whether or not to\r\nrelocate these responsibilities and functions, it ought to be made by\r\nthe Executive and the Congress, perhaps upon recommendations based on\r\nstudies by the previously suggested committee.\r\n\r\n3. Meanwhile, in order to improve daily supervision of the Secret\r\nService within the Department of the Treasury, the Commission\r\nrecommends that the Secretary of the Treasury appoint a special\r\nassistant with the responsibility of supervising the Secret Service.\r\nThis special assistant should have sufficient stature and experience in\r\nlaw enforcement, intelligence, and allied fields to provide effective\r\ncontinuing supervision, and to keep the Secretary fully informed\r\nregarding the performance of the Secret Service. One of the initial\r\nassignments of this special assistant should be the supervision of the\r\ncurrent effort by the Secret Service to revise and modernize its basic\r\noperating procedures.\r\n\r\n4. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service completely\r\noverhaul its facilities devoted to the advance detection of potential\r\nthreats against the President. The Commission suggests the following\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Secret Service should develop as quickly as possible\r\n    more useful and precise criteria defining those potential\r\n    threats to the President which should be brought to its\r\n    attention by other agencies. The criteria should, among other\r\n    additions, provide for prompt notice to the Secret Service of\r\n    all returned defectors.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The Secret Service should expedite its current plans to\r\n    utilize the most efficient data-processing techniques.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Once the Secret Service has formulated new criteria\r\n    delineating the information it desires, it should enter into\r\n    agreements with each Federal agency to insure its receipt of\r\n    such information.\r\n\r\n5. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service improve the\r\nprotective measures followed in the planning, and conducting of\r\nPresidential motorcades. In particular, the Secret Service should\r\ncontinue its current efforts to increase the precautionary attention\r\ngiven to buildings along the motorcade route.\r\n\r\n6. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service continue its\r\nrecent efforts to improve and formalize its relationships with local\r\npolice departments in areas to be visited by the President.\r\n\r\n7. The Commission believes that when the new criteria and procedures\r\nare established, the Secret Service will not have sufficient personnel\r\nor adequate facilities.", "start_char_idx": 120985, "end_char_idx": 126177, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb15121a-efaa-4919-9952-9dd11573f8fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb15121a-efaa-4919-9952-9dd11573f8fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dcef4f57-20e1-406e-98b0-6d343184fe47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "435a79992d9ee7b4e4344c7bee5023701d086260bb44d1b53193daac50836ec8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b9c8a3ef-3307-444f-9ca2-9e5b1d7eb475", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "90dbcd00ec96e81df4675ae3896b9d28d55000c3ed60f27e7673775181d43d90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(_b_) The Secret Service should expedite its current plans to\r\n    utilize the most efficient data-processing techniques.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Once the Secret Service has formulated new criteria\r\n    delineating the information it desires, it should enter into\r\n    agreements with each Federal agency to insure its receipt of\r\n    such information.\r\n\r\n5.

The Commission recommends that the President\u2019s physician always\r\naccompany him during his travels and occupy a position near the\r\nPresident where he can be immediately available in case of any\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\n10. The Commission recommends to Congress that it adopt legislation\r\nwhich would make the assassination of the President and Vice President\r\na Federal crime. A state of affairs where U.S. authorities have no\r\nclearly defined jurisdiction to investigate the assassination of a\r\nPresident is anomalous.\r\n\r\n11. The Commission has examined the Department of State\u2019s handling\r\nof the Oswald matters and finds that it followed the law throughout.\r\nHowever, the Commission believes that the Department in accordance\r\nwith its own regulations should in all cases exercise great care in\r\nthe return to this country of defectors who have evidenced disloyalty\r\nor hostility to this country or who have expressed a desire to\r\nrenounce their American citizenship and that when such persons are so\r\nreturned, procedures should be adopted for the better dissemination\r\nof information concerning them to the intelligence agencies of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n12. The Commission recommends that the representatives of the bar, law\r\nenforcement associations, and the news media work together to establish\r\nethical standards concerning the collection and presentation of\r\ninformation to the public so that there will be no interference with\r\npending criminal investigations, court proceedings, or the right of\r\nindividuals to a fair trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe Assassination\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter describes President Kennedy\u2019s trip to Dallas, from its\r\norigin through its tragic conclusion. The narrative of these events\r\nis based largely on the recollections of the participants, although\r\nin many instances documentary or other evidence has also been used by\r\nthe Commission. Beginning with the advance plans and Secret Service\r\npreparations for the trip, this chapter reviews the motorcade through\r\nDallas, the fleeting moments of the assassination, the activities at\r\nParkland Memorial Hospital, and the return of the Presidential party to\r\nWashington. An evaluation of the procedures employed to safeguard the\r\nPresident, with recommendations for improving these procedures, appears\r\nin chapter VIII of the report.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNING THE TEXAS TRIP\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy\u2019s visit to Texas in November 1963 had been under\r\nconsideration for almost a year before it occurred. He had made\r\nonly a few brief visits to the State since the 1960 Presidential\r\ncampaign and in 1962 he began to consider a formal visit.[C2-1]\r\nDuring 1963, the reasons for making the trip became more persuasive.\r\nAs a political leader, the President wished to resolve the factional\r\ncontroversy within the Democratic Party in Texas before the election\r\nof 1964.[C2-2] The party itself saw an opportunity to raise funds by\r\nhaving the President speak at a political dinner eventually planned\r\nfor Austin.[C2-3] As Chief of State, the President always welcomed the\r\nopportunity to learn, firsthand, about the problems which concerned\r\nthe American people.[C2-4] Moreover, he looked forward to the public\r\nappearances which he personally enjoyed.", "start_char_idx": 125150, "end_char_idx": 130121, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9c8a3ef-3307-444f-9ca2-9e5b1d7eb475": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9c8a3ef-3307-444f-9ca2-9e5b1d7eb475", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb15121a-efaa-4919-9952-9dd11573f8fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "e22ea637a7278e2f8c5bc31d69be1fc3723422777a465ba8ce9681f53e6b304a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c928b82-95db-4020-b251-35c4aaa70f4d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c6ff40bfe22bd429aac9d0edc803f22b4179481353bf62850110bcc966fabb6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He had made\r\nonly a few brief visits to the State since the 1960 Presidential\r\ncampaign and in 1962 he began to consider a formal visit.[C2-1]\r\nDuring 1963, the reasons for making the trip became more persuasive.\r\nAs a political leader, the President wished to resolve the factional\r\ncontroversy within the Democratic Party in Texas before the election\r\nof 1964.[C2-2] The party itself saw an opportunity to raise funds by\r\nhaving the President speak at a political dinner eventually planned\r\nfor Austin.[C2-3] As Chief of State, the President always welcomed the\r\nopportunity to learn, firsthand, about the problems which concerned\r\nthe American people.[C2-4] Moreover, he looked forward to the public\r\nappearances which he personally enjoyed.[C2-5]\r\n\r\nThe basic decision on the November trip to Texas was made at a\r\nmeeting of President Kennedy, Vice President Johnson, and Governor\r\nConnally on June 5, 1963, at the Cortez Hotel in El Paso, Tex.[C2-6]\r\nThe President had spoken earlier that day at the Air Force Academy\r\nin Colorado Springs, Colo., and had stopped in El Paso to discuss\r\nthe proposed visit and other matters with the Vice President and the\r\nGovernor.[C2-7] The three agreed that the President would come to Texas\r\nin late November 1963.[C2-8] The original plan called for the President\r\nto spend only 1 day in the State, making whirlwind visits to Dallas,\r\nFort Worth, San Antonio, and Houston.[C2-9] In September, the White\r\nHouse decided to permit further visits by the President and extended\r\nthe trip to run from the afternoon of November 21 through the evening\r\nof Friday, November 22.[C2-10] When Governor Connally called at the\r\nWhite House on October 4 to discuss the details of the visit, it was\r\nagreed that the planning of events in Texas would be left largely to\r\nthe Governor.[C2-11] At the White House, Kenneth O\u2019Donnell, special\r\nassistant to the President, acted as coordinator for the trip.[C2-12]\r\n\r\nEveryone agreed that, if there was sufficient time, a motorcade through\r\ndowntown Dallas would be the best way for the people to see their\r\nPresident. When the trip was planned for only 1 day, Governor Connally\r\nhad opposed the motorcade because there was not enough time.[C2-13]\r\nThe Governor stated, however, that \u201conce we got San Antonio moved\r\nfrom Friday to Thursday afternoon, where that was his initial stop\r\nin Texas, then we had the time, and I withdrew my objections to\r\na motorcade.\u201d[C2-14] According to O\u2019Donnell, \u201cwe had a motorcade\r\nwherever we went,\u201d particularly in large cities where the purpose was\r\nto let the President be seen by as many people as possible.[C2-15]\r\nIn his experience, \u201cit would be automatic\u201d for the Secret Service\r\nto arrange a route which would, within the time allotted, bring the\r\nPresident \u201cthrough an area which exposes him to the greatest number of\r\npeople.\u201d[C2-16]\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DALLAS TRIP\r\n\r\nAdvance preparations for President Kennedy\u2019s visit to Dallas were\r\nprimarily the responsibility of two Secret Service agents: Special\r\nAgent Winston G. Lawson, a member of the White House detail who acted\r\nas the advance agent, and Forrest V. Sorrels, special agent in charge\r\nof the Dallas office.[C2-17] Both agents were advised of the trip on\r\nNovember 4.[C2-18] Lawson received a tentative schedule of the Texas\r\ntrip on November 8 from Roy H. Kellerman, assistant special agent in\r\ncharge of the White House detail, who was the Secret Service official\r\nresponsible for the entire Texas journey.[C2-19] As advance agent\r\nworking closely with Sorrels, Lawson had responsibility for arranging\r\nthe timetable for the President\u2019s visit to Dallas and coordinating\r\nlocal activities with the White House staff, the organizations directly\r\nconcerned with the visit, and local law enforcement officials.[C2-20]\r\nLawson\u2019s most important responsibilities were to take preventive\r\naction against anyone in Dallas considered a threat to the President,\r\nto select the luncheon site and motorcade route, and to plan security\r\nmeasures for the luncheon and the motorcade.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventive Intelligence Activities\r\n\r\nThe Protective Research Section (PRS) of the Secret Service maintains\r\nrecords of people who have threatened the President or so conducted\r\nthemselves as to be deemed a potential danger to him.", "start_char_idx": 129377, "end_char_idx": 133671, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c928b82-95db-4020-b251-35c4aaa70f4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c928b82-95db-4020-b251-35c4aaa70f4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9c8a3ef-3307-444f-9ca2-9e5b1d7eb475", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "1120cd6ceeabab3be9e15a4fdab2d7e2b2897b5d69c407d8f1bf0d13848ce7de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "47b1d0a9-e86e-44b6-bb3a-7eb7a40eca43", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "24cebfeece68873e65f4c824d98984132243a870b04d3cdf0fc274aa30553596", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C2-19] As advance agent\r\nworking closely with Sorrels, Lawson had responsibility for arranging\r\nthe timetable for the President\u2019s visit to Dallas and coordinating\r\nlocal activities with the White House staff, the organizations directly\r\nconcerned with the visit, and local law enforcement officials.[C2-20]\r\nLawson\u2019s most important responsibilities were to take preventive\r\naction against anyone in Dallas considered a threat to the President,\r\nto select the luncheon site and motorcade route, and to plan security\r\nmeasures for the luncheon and the motorcade.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventive Intelligence Activities\r\n\r\nThe Protective Research Section (PRS) of the Secret Service maintains\r\nrecords of people who have threatened the President or so conducted\r\nthemselves as to be deemed a potential danger to him. On November 8,\r\n1963, after undertaking the responsibility for advance preparations\r\nfor the visit to Dallas, Agent Lawson went to the PRS offices in\r\nWashington. A check of the geographic indexes there revealed no listing\r\nfor any individual deemed to be a potential danger to the President\r\nin the territory of the Secret Service regional office which includes\r\nDallas and Fort Worth.[C2-21]\r\n\r\nTo supplement the PRS files, the Secret Service depends largely on\r\nlocal police departments and local offices of other Federal agencies\r\nwhich advise it of potential threats immediately before the visit\r\nof the President to their community. Upon his arrival in Dallas on\r\nNovember 12 Lawson conferred with the local police and the local\r\noffice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation about potential dangers\r\nto the President. Although there was no mention in PRS files of the\r\ndemonstration in Dallas against Ambassador Adlai Stevenson on October\r\n24, 1963, Lawson inquired about the incident and obtained through the\r\nlocal police photographs of some of the persons involved.[C2-22] On\r\nNovember 22 a Secret Service agent stood at the entrance to the Trade\r\nMart, where the President was scheduled to speak, with copies of these\r\nphotographs. Dallas detectives in the lobby of the Trade Mart and in\r\nthe luncheon area also had copies of these photographs. A number of\r\npeople who resembled some of those in the photographs were placed under\r\nsurveillance at the Trade Mart.[C2-23]\r\n\r\nThe FBI office in Dallas gave the local Secret Service representatives\r\nthe name of a possibly dangerous individual in the Dallas area who was\r\ninvestigated. It also advised the Secret Service of the circulation on\r\nNovember 21 of a handbill sharply critical of President Kennedy,[C2-24]\r\ndiscussed in chapter VI of this report. Shortly before, the Dallas\r\npolice had reported to the Secret Service that the handbill had\r\nappeared on the streets of Dallas. Neither the Dallas police nor the\r\nFBI had yet learned the source of the handbill.[C2-25] No one else was\r\nidentified to the Secret Service through local inquiry as potentially\r\ndangerous, nor did PRS develop any additional information between\r\nNovember 12, when Lawson left Washington, and November 22. The adequacy\r\nof the intelligence system maintained by the Secret Service at the time\r\nof the assassination, including a detailed description of the available\r\ndata on Lee Harvey Oswald and the reasons why his name had not been\r\nfurnished to the Secret Service, is discussed in chapter VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Luncheon Site\r\n\r\nAn important purpose of the President\u2019s visit to Dallas was to speak at\r\na luncheon given by business and civic leaders. The White House staff\r\ninformed the Secret Service that the President would arrive and depart\r\nfrom Dallas\u2019 Love Field; that a motorcade through the downtown area of\r\nDallas to the luncheon site should be arranged; and that following the\r\nluncheon the President would return to the airport by the most direct\r\nroute. Accordingly, it was important to determine the luncheon site as\r\nquickly as possible, so that security could be established at the site\r\nand the motorcade route selected.\r\n\r\nOn November 4, Gerald A. Behn, agent in charge of the White House\r\ndetail, asked Sorrels to examine three potential sites for the\r\nluncheon.[C2-26] One building, Market Hall, was unavailable for\r\nNovember 22. The second, the Women\u2019s Building at the State Fair\r\nGrounds, was a one-story building with few entrances and easy to make\r\nsecure, but it lacked necessary food-handling facilities and had\r\ncertain unattractive features, including a low ceiling with exposed\r\nconduits and beams.

The third possibility, the Trade Mart, a handsome\r\nnew building with all the necessary facilities, presented security\r\nproblems. It had numerous entrances, several tiers of balconies\r\nsurrounding the central court where the luncheon would be held, and\r\nseveral catwalks crossing the court at each level. On November 4,\r\nSorrels told Behn he believed security difficulties at the Trade Mart\r\ncould be overcome by special precautions.[C2-27] Lawson also evaluated\r\nthe security hazards at the Trade Mart on November 13.[C2-28] Kenneth\r\nO\u2019Donnell made the final decision to hold the luncheon at the Trade\r\nMart; Behn so notified Lawson on November 14.[C2-29]\r\n\r\nOnce the Trade Mart had been selected, Sorrels and Lawson worked out\r\ndetailed arrangements for security at the building. In addition to the\r\npreventive measures already mentioned, they provided for controlling\r\naccess to the building, closing off and policing areas around it,\r\nsecuring the roof and insuring the presence of numerous police\r\nofficers inside and around the building. Ultimately more than 200 law\r\nenforcement officers, mainly Dallas police but including 8 Secret\r\nService agents, were deployed in and around the Trade Mart.[C2-30]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Motorcade Route\r\n\r\nOn November 8, when Lawson was briefed on the itinerary for the trip to\r\nDallas, he was told that 45 minutes had been allotted for a motorcade\r\nprocession from Love Field to the luncheon site.[C2-31] Lawson was not\r\nspecifically instructed to select the parade route, but he understood\r\nthat this was one of his functions.[C2-32] Even before the Trade Mart\r\nhad been definitely selected, Lawson and Sorrels began to consider the\r\nbest motorcade route from Love Field to the Trade Mart. On November 14,\r\nLawson and Sorrels attended a meeting at Love Field and on their return\r\nto Dallas drove over the route which Sorrels believed best suited for\r\nthe proposed motorcade.[C2-33] This route, eventually selected for the\r\nmotorcade from the airport to the Trade Mart, measured 10 miles and\r\ncould be driven easily within the allotted 45 minutes.[C2-34] From Love\r\nField the route passed through a portion of suburban Dallas, through\r\nthe downtown area along Main Street and then to the Trade Mart via\r\nStemmons Freeway. For the President\u2019s return to Love Field following\r\nthe luncheon, the agents selected the most direct route, which was\r\napproximately 4 miles.[C2-35]\r\n\r\nAfter the selection of the Trade Mart as the luncheon site, Lawson\r\nand Sorrels met with Dallas Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry, Assistant\r\nChief Charles Batchelor, Deputy Chief N.\u00a0T. Fisher, and several other\r\ncommand officers to discuss details of the motorcade and possible\r\nroutes.[C2-36] The route was further reviewed by Lawson and Sorrels\r\nwith Assistant Chief Batchelor and members of the local host committee\r\non November 15. The police officials agreed that the route recommended\r\nby Sorrels was the proper one and did not express a belief that any\r\nother route might be better.[C2-37] On November 18, Sorrels and Lawson\r\ndrove over the selected route with Batchelor and other police officers,\r\nverifying that it could be traversed within 45 minutes.

Representatives\r\nof the local host committee and the White House staff were advised by\r\nthe Secret Service of the actual route on the afternoon of November\r\n18.[C2-38]\r\n\r\nThe route impressed the agents as a natural and desirable one. Sorrels,\r\nwho had participated in Presidential protection assignments in Dallas\r\nsince a visit by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936,[C2-39]\r\ntestified that the traditional parade route in Dallas was along Main\r\nStreet, since the tall buildings along the street gave more people an\r\nopportunity to participate.[C2-40] The route chosen from the airport\r\nto Main Street was the normal one, except where Harwood Street was\r\nselected as the means of access to Main Street in preference to a short\r\nstretch of the Central Expressway, which presented a minor safety\r\nhazard and could not accommodate spectators as conveniently as Harwood\r\nStreet.[C2-41] According to Lawson, the chosen route seemed to be the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n    It afforded us wide streets most of the way, because of the\r\n    buses that were in the motorcade. It afforded us a chance to\r\n    have alternative routes if something happened on the motorcade\r\n    route. It was the type of suburban area a good part of the way\r\n    where the crowds would be able to be controlled for a great\r\n    distance, and we figured that the largest crowds would be\r\n    downtown, which they were, and that the wide streets that we\r\n    would use downtown would be of sufficient width to keep the\r\n    public out of our way.[C2-42]\r\n\r\nElm Street, parallel to Main Street and one block north, was not used\r\nfor the main portion of the downtown part of the motorcade because Main\r\nStreet offered better vantage points for spectators.\r\n\r\nTo reach the Trade Mart from Main Street the agents decided to use\r\nthe Stemmons Freeway (Route No. 77), the most direct route. The only\r\npractical way for westbound traffic on Main Street to reach the\r\nnorthbound lanes of the Stemmons Freeway is via Elm Street, which\r\nRoute No. 77 traffic is instructed to follow in this part of the\r\ncity. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2113, p. 34.) Elm Street was to be\r\nreached from Main by turning right at Houston, going one block north\r\nand then turning left onto Elm. On this last portion of the journey,\r\nonly 5 minutes from the Trade Mart, the President\u2019s motorcade would\r\npass the Texas School Book Depository Building on the northwest corner\r\nof Houston and Elm Streets. The building overlooks Dealey Plaza,\r\nan attractively landscaped triangle of 3 acres. (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 876, p. 33.) From Houston Street, which forms the base\r\nof the triangle, three streets--Commerce, Main, and Elm--trisect\r\nthe plaza, converging at the apex of the triangle to form a triple\r\nunderpass beneath a multiple railroad bridge almost 500 feet from\r\nHouston Street.[C2-43] Elm Street, the northernmost of the three,\r\nafter intersecting Houston curves in a southwesterly arc through the\r\nunderpass and leads into an access road, which branches off to the\r\nright and is used by traffic going to the Stemmons Freeway and the\r\nDallas-Fort Worth Turnpike.

To\r\ncreate this traffic pattern, a concrete barrier between Main and Elm\r\nStreets presents an obstacle to a right turn from Main across Elm to\r\nthe access road to Stemmons Freeway and the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike.\r\nThis concrete barrier extends far enough beyond the access road to\r\nmake it impracticable for vehicles to turn right from Main directly to\r\nthe access road. A sign located on this barrier instructs Main Street\r\ntraffic not to make any turns.[C2-45] (See Commission Exhibits Nos.\r\n2114-2116, pp. 35-37.) In conformity with these arrangements, traffic\r\nproceeding west on Main is directed to turn right at Houston in order\r\nto reach the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike, which has the same access road\r\nfrom Elm Street as does the Stemmons Freeway.[C2-46] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 2967, p. 38.)\r\n\r\nThe planning for the motorcade also included advance preparations for\r\nsecurity arrangements along the route. Sorrels and Lawson reviewed the\r\nroute in cooperation with Assistant Chief Batchelor and other Dallas\r\npolice officials who took notes on the requirements for controlling the\r\ncrowds and traffic, watching the overpasses, and providing motorcycle\r\nescort.[C2-47] To control traffic, arrangements were made for the\r\ndeployment of foot patrolmen and motorcycle police at various positions\r\nalong the route.[C2-48] Police were assigned to each overpass on the\r\nroute and instructed to keep them clear of unauthorized persons.[C2-49]\r\nNo arrangements were made for police or building custodians to inspect\r\nbuildings along the motorcade route since the Secret Service did\r\nnot normally request or make such a check.[C2-50] Under standard\r\nprocedures, the responsibility for watching the windows of buildings\r\nwas shared by local police stationed along the route and Secret Service\r\nagents riding in the motorcade.[C2-51]\r\n\r\nAs the date for the President\u2019s visit approached, the two Dallas\r\nnewspapers carried several reports of his motorcade route.

The\r\nselection of the Trade Mart as the possible site for the luncheon first\r\nappeared in the Dallas Times-Herald on November 15, 1963.[C2-52] The\r\nfollowing day, the newspaper reported that the Presidential party\r\n\u201capparently will loop through the downtown area, probably on Main\r\nStreet, en route from Dallas Love Field\u201d on its way to the Trade\r\nMart.[C2-53] On November 19, the Times-Herald afternoon paper detailed\r\nthe precise route:\r\n\r\n    From the airport, the President\u2019s party will proceed to\r\n    Mockingbird Lane to Lemmon and then to Turtle Creek, turning\r\n    south to Cedar Springs.\r\n\r\n    The motorcade will then pass through downtown on Harwood and\r\n    then west on Main, turning back to Elm at Houston and then out\r\n    Stemmons Freeway to the Trade Mart.[C2-54]\r\n\r\nAlso on November 19, the Morning News reported that the President\u2019s\r\nmotorcade would travel from Love Field along specified streets, then\r\n\u201cHarwood to Main, Main to Houston, Houston to Elm, Elm under the Triple\r\nUnderpass to Stemmons Freeway, and on to the Trade Mart.\u201d[C2-55] On\r\nNovember 20 a front page story reported that the streets on which\r\nthe Presidential motorcade would travel included \u201cMain and Stemmons\r\nFreeway.\u201d[C2-56] On the morning of the President\u2019s arrival, the Morning\r\nNews noted that the motorcade would travel through downtown Dallas onto\r\nthe Stemmons Freeway, and reported that \u201cthe motorcade will move slowly\r\nso that crowds can \u2018get a good view\u2019 of President Kennedy and his\r\nwife.\u201d[C2-57]\r\n\r\n\r\nDALLAS BEFORE THE VISIT\r\n\r\nThe President\u2019s intention to pay a visit to Texas in the fall of 1963\r\naroused interest throughout the State. The two Dallas newspapers\r\nprovided their readers with a steady stream of information and\r\nspeculation about the trip, beginning on September 13, when the\r\nTimes-Herald announced in a front page article that President Kennedy\r\nwas planning a brief 1-day tour of four Texas cities--Dallas, Fort\r\nWorth, San Antonio, and Houston.[C2-58] Both Dallas papers cited White\r\nHouse sources on September 26 as confirming the President\u2019s intention\r\nto visit Texas on November 21 and 22, with Dallas scheduled as one of\r\nthe stops.[C2-59]\r\n\r\nArticles, editorials, and letters to the editor in the Dallas Morning\r\nNews and the Dallas Times-Herald after September 13 reflected the\r\nfeeling in the community toward the forthcoming Presidential visit.\r\nAlthough there were critical editorials and letters to the editors, the\r\nnews stories reflected the desire of Dallas officials to welcome the\r\nPresident with dignity and courtesy. An editorial in the Times-Herald\r\nof September 17 called on the people of Dallas to be \u201ccongenial\r\nhosts\u201d even though \u201cDallas didn\u2019t vote for Mr. Kennedy in 1960, may\r\nnot endorse him in \u201964.\u201d[C2-60] On October 3 the Dallas Morning News\r\nquoted U.S. Representative Joe Pool\u2019s hope that President Kennedy would\r\nreceive a \u201cgood welcome\u201d and would not face demonstrations like those\r\nencountered by Vice President Johnson during the 1960 campaign.[C2-61]\r\n\r\nIncreased concern about the President\u2019s visit was aroused by the\r\nincident involving the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai\r\nE.

Mayor Earle Cabell called on the\r\ncity to redeem itself during President Kennedy\u2019s visit.[C2-63] He\r\nasserted that Dallas had shed its reputation of the twenties as the\r\n\u201cSouthwest hate capital of Dixie.\u201d[C2-64] On October 26 the press\r\nreported Chief of Police Curry\u2019s plans to call in 100 extra off-duty\r\nofficers to help protect President Kennedy.[C2-65] Any thought that\r\nthe President might cancel his visit to Dallas was ended when Governor\r\nConnally confirmed on November 8 that the President would come to Texas\r\non November 21-22, and that he would visit San Antonio, Houston, Fort\r\nWorth, Dallas, and Austin.[C2-66]\r\n\r\nDuring November the Dallas papers reported frequently on the plans\r\nfor protecting the President, stressing the thoroughness of the\r\npreparations. They conveyed the pleas of Dallas leaders that citizens\r\nnot demonstrate or create disturbances during the President\u2019s visit.\r\nOn November 18 the Dallas City Council adopted a new city ordinance\r\nprohibiting interference with attendance at lawful assemblies.[C2-67]\r\nTwo days before the President\u2019s arrival Chief Curry warned that the\r\nDallas police would not permit improper conduct during the President\u2019s\r\nvisit.[C2-68]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on November 17 the president of the Dallas Chamber of\r\nCommerce referred to the city\u2019s reputation for being the friendliest\r\ntown in America and asserted that citizens would \u201cgreet the President\r\nof the United States with the warmth and pride that keep the Dallas\r\nspirit famous the world over.\u201d[C2-69] Two days later, a local\r\nRepublican leader called for a \u201ccivilized nonpartisan\u201d welcome for\r\nPresident Kennedy, stating that \u201cin many respects Dallas County has\r\nisolated itself from the main stream of life in the world in this\r\ndecade.\u201d[C2-70]\r\n\r\nAnother reaction to the impending visit--hostile to the President--came\r\nto a head shortly before his arrival. On November 21 there appeared\r\non the streets of Dallas the anonymous handbill mentioned above. It\r\nwas fashioned after the \u201cwanted\u201d circulars issued by law enforcement\r\nagencies. Beneath two photographs of President Kennedy, one fullface\r\nand one profile, appeared the caption, \u201cWanted for Treason,\u201d followed\r\nby a scurrilous bill of particulars that constituted a vilification of\r\nthe President.[C2-71] And on the morning of the President\u2019s arrival,\r\nthere appeared in the Morning News a full page, black-bordered\r\nadvertisement headed \u201cWelcome Mr. Kennedy to Dallas,\u201d sponsored by\r\nthe American Factfinding Committee, which the sponsor later testified\r\nwas an ad hoc committee \u201cformed strictly for the purpose of having\r\na name to put in the paper.\u201d[C2-72] The \u201cwelcome\u201d consisted of a\r\nseries of statements and questions critical of the President and his\r\nadministration.[C2-73] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1031, p. 294.)\r\n\r\n\r\nVISITS TO OTHER TEXAS CITIES\r\n\r\nThe trip to Texas began with the departure of President and Mrs.\r\nKennedy from the White House by helicopter at 10:45 a.m., e.s.t., on\r\nNovember 21, 1963, for Andrews AFB.

Hill had to leave the left front running board of\r\nthe President\u2019s followup car four times to ride on the rear of the\r\nPresident\u2019s limousine.[C2-132] (See Commission Exhibit No. 698, p. 47.)\r\nSeveral times Special Agent John D. Ready came forward from the right\r\nfront running board of the Presidential followup car to the right side\r\nof the President\u2019s car.[C2-133] Special Agent Glen A.

When a teenage boy ran toward the rear of the\r\nPresident\u2019s car,[C2-134] Ready left the running board to chase the boy\r\nback into the crowd. On several occasions when the Vice President\u2019s\r\ncar was slowed down by the throng, Special Agent Youngblood stepped out\r\nto hold the crowd back.[C2-135]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 698\r\n\r\nPresidential limousine in Dallas motorcade.]\r\n\r\nAccording to plan, the President\u2019s motorcade proceeded west through\r\ndowntown Dallas on Main Street to the intersection of Houston Street,\r\nwhich marks the beginning of Dealey Plaza.[C2-136] From Main Street\r\nthe motorcade turned right and went north on Houston Street, passing\r\ntall buildings on the right, and headed toward the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Building.[C2-137] The spectators were still thickly\r\ncongregated in front of the buildings which lined the east side of\r\nHouston Street, but the crowd thinned abruptly along Elm Street, which\r\ncurves in a southwesterly direction as it proceeds downgrade toward the\r\nTriple Underpass and the Stemmons Freeway.[C2-138]\r\n\r\nAs the motorcade approached the intersection of Houston and Elm\r\nStreets, there was general gratification in the Presidential party\r\nabout the enthusiastic reception.

One bullet passed through the\r\nPresident\u2019s neck; a subsequent bullet, which was lethal, shattered the\r\nright side of his skull. Governor Connally sustained bullet wounds in\r\nhis back, the right side of his chest, right wrist, and left thigh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Time\r\n\r\nThe exact time of the assassination was fixed by the testimony of four\r\nwitnesses. Special Agent Rufus W. Youngblood observed that the large\r\nelectric sign clock atop the Texas School Book Depository Building\r\nshowed the numerals \u201c12:30\u201d as the Vice-Presidential automobile\r\nproceeded north on Houston Street, a few seconds before the shots were\r\nfired.[C2-141] Just prior to the shooting, David F. Powers, riding in\r\nthe Secret Service followup car, remarked to Kenneth O\u2019Donnell that\r\nit was 12:30 p.m., the time they were due at the Trade Mart.[C2-142]\r\nSeconds after the shooting, Roy Kellerman, riding in the front seat\r\nof the Presidential limousine, looked at his watch and said \u201c12:30\u201d\r\nto the driver, Special Agent Greer.[C2-143] The Dallas police radio\r\nlog reflects that Chief of Police Curry reported the shooting of the\r\nPresident and issued his initial orders at 12:30 p.m.[C2-144]\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeed of the Limousine\r\n\r\nWilliam Greer, operator of the Presidential limousine, estimated\r\nthe car\u2019s speed at the time of the first shot as 12 to 15 miles per\r\nhour.[C2-145] Other witnesses in the motorcade estimated the speed\r\nof the President\u2019s limousine from 7 to 22 miles per hour.[C2-146] A\r\nmore precise determination has been made from motion pictures taken\r\non the scene by an amateur photographer, Abraham Zapruder. Based on\r\nthese films, the speed of the President\u2019s automobile is computed at an\r\naverage speed of 11.2 miles per hour. The car maintained this average\r\nspeed over a distance of approximately 136 feet immediately preceding\r\nthe shot which struck the President in the head. While the car traveled\r\nthis distance, the Zapruder camera ran 152 frames. Since the camera\r\noperates at a speed of 18.3 frames per second, it was calculated that\r\nthe car required 8.3 seconds to cover the 136 feet. This represents a\r\nspeed of 11.2 miles per hour.[C2-147]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Presidential Limousine\r\n\r\nMrs. John F. Kennedy, on the left of the rear seat of the limousine,\r\nlooked toward her left and waved to the crowds along the route. Soon\r\nafter the motorcade turned onto Elm Street, she heard a sound similar\r\nto a motorcycle noise and a cry from Governor Connally, which caused\r\nher to look to her right. On turning she saw a quizzical look on her\r\nhusband\u2019s face as he raised his left hand to his throat. Mrs. Kennedy\r\nthen heard a second shot and saw the President\u2019s skull torn open under\r\nthe impact of the bullet.

I love you,\r\nJack.\u201d[C2-148]\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally testified that he recognized the first noise as a\r\nrifle shot and the thought immediately crossed his mind that it was\r\nan assassination attempt. From his position in the right jump seat\r\nimmediately in front of the President, he instinctively turned to his\r\nright because the shot appeared to come from over his right shoulder.\r\nUnable to see the President as he turned to the right, the Governor\r\nstarted to look back over his left shoulder, but he never completed the\r\nturn because he felt something strike him in the back.[C2-149] In his\r\ntestimony before the Commission, Governor Connally was certain that he\r\nwas hit by the second shot, which he stated he did not hear.[C2-150]\r\n\r\nMrs. Connally, too, heard a frightening noise from her right. Looking\r\nover her right shoulder, she saw that the President had both hands\r\nat his neck but she observed no blood and heard nothing. She watched\r\nas he slumped down with an empty expression on his face.[C2-151] Roy\r\nKellerman, in the right front seat of the limousine, heard a report\r\nlike a firecracker pop. Turning to his right in the direction of the\r\nnoise, Kellerman heard the President say \u201cMy God, I am hit,\u201d and saw\r\nboth of the President\u2019s hands move up toward his neck. As he told the\r\ndriver, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here; we are hit,\u201d Kellerman grabbed his\r\nmicrophone and radioed ahead to the lead car, \u201cWe are hit. Get us to\r\nthe hospital immediately.\u201d[C2-152]\r\n\r\nThe driver, William Greer, heard a noise which he took to be a backfire\r\nfrom one of the motorcycles flanking the Presidential car. When he\r\nheard the same noise again, Greer glanced over his shoulder and saw\r\nGovernor Connally fall. At the sound of the second shot he realized\r\nthat something was wrong, and he pressed down on the accelerator as\r\nKellerman said, \u201cGet out of here fast.\u201d[C2-153] As he issued his\r\ninstructions to Greer and to the lead car, Kellerman heard a \u201cflurry\r\nof shots\u201d within 5 seconds of the first noise. According to Kellerman,\r\nMrs. Kennedy then cried out: \u201cWhat are they doing to you?\u201d Looking back\r\nfrom the front seat, Kellerman saw Governor Connally in his wife\u2019s\r\nlap and Special Agent Clinton J. Hill lying across the trunk of the\r\ncar.[C2-154]\r\n\r\nMrs. Connally heard a second shot fired and pulled her husband down\r\ninto her lap.[C2-155] Observing his blood-covered chest as he was\r\npulled into his wife\u2019s lap, Governor Connally believed himself mortally\r\nwounded. He cried out, \u201cOh, no, no, no.

Be\r\nstill.\u201d[C2-157] The Governor was lying with his head on his wife\u2019s lap\r\nwhen he heard a shot hit the President.[C2-158] At that point, both\r\nGovernor and Mrs. Connally observed brain tissue splattered over the\r\ninterior of the car.[C2-159] According to Governor and Mrs. Connally,\r\nit was after this shot that Kellerman issued his emergency instructions\r\nand the car accelerated.[C2-160]\r\n\r\n\r\nReaction by Secret Service Agents\r\n\r\nFrom the left front running board of the President\u2019s followup car,\r\nSpecial Agent Hill was scanning the few people standing on the south\r\nside of Elm Street after the motorcade had turned off Houston Street.\r\nHe estimated that the motorcade had slowed down to approximately 9 or\r\n10 miles per hour on the turn at the intersection of Houston and Elm\r\nStreets and then proceeded at a rate of 12 to 15 miles per hour with\r\nthe followup car trailing the President\u2019s automobile by approximately\r\n5 feet.[C2-161] Hill heard a noise, which seemed to be a firecracker,\r\ncoming from his right rear. He immediately looked to his right,\r\n\u201cand, in so doing, my eyes had to cross the Presidential limousine\r\nand I saw President Kennedy grab at himself and lurch forward and to\r\nthe left.\u201d[C2-162] Hill jumped from the followup car and ran to the\r\nPresident\u2019s automobile. At about the time he reached the President\u2019s\r\nautomobile, Hill heard a second shot, approximately 5 seconds after the\r\nfirst, which removed a portion of the President\u2019s head.[C2-163]\r\n\r\nAt the instant that Hill stepped onto the left rear step of the\r\nPresident\u2019s automobile and grasped the handhold, the car lurched\r\nforward, causing him to lose his footing. He ran three or four steps,\r\nregained his position and mounted the car. Between the time he\r\noriginally seized the handhold and the time he mounted the car, Hill\r\nrecalled that--\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Kennedy had jumped up from the seat and was, it appeared\r\n    to me, reaching for something coming off the right rear bumper\r\n    of the car, the right rear tail, when she noticed that I was\r\n    trying to climb on the car. She turned toward me and I grabbed\r\n    her and put her back in the back seat, crawled up on top of the\r\n    back seat and lay there.[C2-164]\r\n\r\nDavid Powers, who witnessed the scene from the President\u2019s followup\r\ncar, stated that Mrs. Kennedy would probably have fallen off the rear\r\nend of the car and been killed if Hill had not pushed her back into the\r\nPresidential automobile.[C2-165] Mrs. Kennedy had no recollection of\r\nclimbing onto the back of the car.[C2-166]\r\n\r\nSpecial Agent Ready, on the right front running board of the\r\nPresidential followup car, heard noises that sounded like firecrackers\r\nand ran toward the President\u2019s limousine. But he was immediately called\r\nback by Special Agent Emory P. Roberts, in charge of the followup car,\r\nwho did not believe that he could reach the President\u2019s car at the\r\nspeed it was then traveling.[C2-167] Special Agent George W. Hickey,\r\nJr., in the rear seat of the Presidential followup car, picked up and\r\ncocked an automatic rifle as he heard the last shot. At this point the\r\ncars were speeding through the underpass and had left the scene of the\r\nshooting, but Hickey kept the automatic weapon ready as the car raced\r\nto the hospital.[C2-168] Most of the other Secret Service agents in\r\nthe motorcade had drawn their sidearms.[C2-169] Roberts noticed that\r\nthe Vice President\u2019s car was approximately one-half block behind the\r\nPresidential followup car at the time of the shooting and signaled for\r\nit to move in closer.[C2-170]\r\n\r\nDirecting the security detail for the Vice President from the right\r\nfront seat of the Vice-Presidential car, Special Agent Youngblood\r\nrecalled:\r\n\r\n    As we were beginning to go down this incline, all of a sudden\r\n    there was an explosive noise.", "start_char_idx": 173286, "end_char_idx": 177354, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4eb55132-8c87-436b-af77-14b192d8ead4": {"__data__": {"id_": "4eb55132-8c87-436b-af77-14b192d8ead4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "95c4d2b7-1870-449a-98c7-0a22cf7ff850", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "f9a1075cca82cfa99144603b2ebc2aebaf01d6e5cf2452ed1e0f6206425e97ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b1851377-4c83-47fb-b89e-f1631f0ff057", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eb99bd89f2fe43b3fd2070a370bb749c2d0875f99eec047ddbce49f3446a9f0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "At this point the\r\ncars were speeding through the underpass and had left the scene of the\r\nshooting, but Hickey kept the automatic weapon ready as the car raced\r\nto the hospital.[C2-168] Most of the other Secret Service agents in\r\nthe motorcade had drawn their sidearms.[C2-169] Roberts noticed that\r\nthe Vice President\u2019s car was approximately one-half block behind the\r\nPresidential followup car at the time of the shooting and signaled for\r\nit to move in closer.[C2-170]\r\n\r\nDirecting the security detail for the Vice President from the right\r\nfront seat of the Vice-Presidential car, Special Agent Youngblood\r\nrecalled:\r\n\r\n    As we were beginning to go down this incline, all of a sudden\r\n    there was an explosive noise.

So I turned around\r\n    and hit the Vice President on the shoulder and hollered, get\r\n    down, and then looked around again and saw more of this\r\n    movement, and so I proceeded to go to the back seat and get on\r\n    top of him.[C2-171]\r\n\r\nYoungblood was not positive that he was in the rear seat before the\r\nsecond shot, but thought it probable because of President Johnson\u2019s\r\nstatement to that effect immediately after the assassination.[C2-172]\r\nPresident Johnson emphasized Youngblood\u2019s instantaneous reaction after\r\nthe first shot:\r\n\r\n    I was startled by the sharp report or explosion, but I had no\r\n    time to speculate as to its origin because Agent Youngblood\r\n    turned in a flash, immediately after the first explosion,\r\n    hitting me on the shoulder, and shouted to all of us in the\r\n    back seat to get down. I was pushed down by Agent Youngblood.\r\n    Almost in the same moment in which he hit or pushed me, he\r\n    vaulted over the back seat and sat on me. I was bent over under\r\n    the weight of Agent Youngblood\u2019s body, toward Mrs. Johnson and\r\n    Senator Yarborough.[C2-173]\r\n\r\nClifton C. Carter, riding in the Vice President\u2019s followup car a short\r\ndistance behind, reported that Youngblood was in the rear seat using\r\nhis body to shield the Vice President before the second and third shots\r\nwere fired.[C2-174]\r\n\r\nOther Secret Service agents assigned to the motorcade remained at\r\ntheir posts during the race to the hospital. None stayed at the scene\r\nof the shooting, and none entered the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding at or immediately after the shooting. Secret Service procedure\r\nrequires that each agent stay with the person being protected and\r\nnot be diverted unless it is necessary to accomplish the protective\r\nassignment.[C2-175] Forrest V. Sorrels, special agent in charge of the\r\nDallas office, was the first Secret Service agent to return to the\r\nscene of the assassination, approximately 20 or 25 minutes after the\r\nshots were fired.[C2-176]\r\n\r\n\r\nPARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nThe Race to the Hospital\r\n\r\nIn the final instant of the assassination, the Presidential motorcade\r\nbegan a race to Parkland Memorial Hospital, approximately 4 miles from\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository Building.[C2-177] On receipt of the\r\nradio message from Kellerman to the lead car that the President had\r\nbeen hit, Chief of Police Curry and police motorcyclists at the head\r\nof the motorcade led the way to the hospital.[C2-178] Meanwhile, Chief\r\nCurry ordered the police base station to notify Parkland Hospital that\r\nthe wounded President was en route.[C2-179] The radio log of the Dallas\r\nPolice Department shows that at 12:30 p.m. on November 22 Chief Curry\r\nradioed, \u201cGo to the hospital--Parkland Hospital.

Malcolm O. Perry, Charles R. Baxter, Robert N. McClelland,\r\nRonald C. Jones; the chief neurologist, Dr. William Kemp Clark; 4\r\nanesthesiologists, Drs. Marion T. Jenkins, Adolph H.

Despite his serious wounds, Governor Connally tried\r\nto get out of the way so that medical help could reach the President.\r\nAlthough he was reclining in his wife\u2019s arms, he lurched forward in\r\nan effort to stand upright and get out of the car, but he collapsed\r\nagain. Then he experienced his first sensation of pain, which became\r\nexcruciating.[C2-189] The Governor was lifted onto a stretcher and\r\ntaken into trauma room 2.[C2-190] For a moment, Mrs. Kennedy refused to\r\nrelease the President, whom she held in her lap, but then Kellerman,\r\nGreer, and Lawson lifted the President onto a stretcher and pushed it\r\ninto trauma room 1.[C2-191]\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of President Kennedy\r\n\r\nThe first physician to see the President at Parkland Hospital was Dr.\r\nCharles J.

Perry, who arrived at trauma room 1 a few moments after\r\nthe President.[C2-203] Dr. Perry noted the President\u2019s back brace as\r\nhe felt for a femoral pulse, which he did not find.[C2-204] Observing\r\nthat an effective airway had to be established if treatment was to be\r\neffective, Dr. Perry performed a tracheotomy, which required 3 to 5\r\nminutes.[C2-205] While Dr. Perry was performing the tracheotomy, Drs.\r\nCarrico and Ronald Jones made cutdowns on the President\u2019s right leg and\r\nleft arm, respectively, to infuse blood and fluids into the circulatory\r\nsystem.[C2-206] Dr. Carrico treated the President\u2019s known adrenal\r\ninsufficiency by administering hydrocortisone.[C2-207] Dr. Robert\r\nN. McClelland entered at that point and assisted Dr. Perry with the\r\ntracheotomy.[C2-208]\r\n\r\nDr. Fouad Bashour, chief of cardiology, Dr. M.\u00a0T. Jenkins, chief\r\nof anesthesiology, and Dr. A.\u00a0H. Giesecke, Jr., then joined in the\r\neffort to revive the President.[C2-209] When Dr. Perry noted free air\r\nand blood in the President\u2019s chest cavity, he asked that chest tubes\r\nbe inserted to allow for drainage of blood and air.

According to\r\nDr. Clark, the small bullet hole on the right rear of the President\u2019s\r\nhead discovered during the subsequent autopsy \u201ccould have easily been\r\nhidden in the blood and hair.\u201d[C2-214]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any neurological, muscular, or heart response,\r\nthe doctors concluded that efforts to revive the President were\r\nhopeless.[C2-215] This was verified by Admiral Burkley, the President\u2019s\r\nphysician, who arrived at the hospital after emergency treatment\r\nwas underway and concluded that \u201cmy direct services to him at that\r\nmoment would have interfered with the action of the team which was\r\nin progress.\u201d[C2-216] At approximately 1 p.m., after last rites were\r\nadministered to the President by Father Oscar L. Huber, Dr. Clark\r\npronounced the President dead. He made the official determination\r\nbecause the ultimate cause of death, the severe head injury, was within\r\nhis sphere of specialization.[C2-217] The time was fixed at 1 p.m.,\r\nas an approximation, since it was impossible to determine the precise\r\nmoment when life left the President.[C2-218] President Kennedy could\r\nhave survived the neck injury, but the head wound was fatal.[C2-219]\r\nFrom a medical viewpoint, President Kennedy was alive when he arrived\r\nat Parkland Hospital; the doctors observed that he had a heart beat\r\nand was making some respiratory efforts.[C2-220] But his condition was\r\nhopeless, and the extraordinary efforts of the doctors to save him\r\ncould not help but to have been unavailing.\r\n\r\nSince the Dallas doctors directed all their efforts to controlling the\r\nmassive bleeding caused by the head wound, and to reconstructing an\r\nairway to his lungs, the President remained on his back throughout his\r\nmedical treatment at Parkland.[C2-221] When asked why he did not turn\r\nthe President over, Dr. Carrico testified as follows:\r\n\r\n    A. This man was in obvious extreme distress and any more\r\n    thorough inspection would have involved several minutes--well,\r\n    several--considerable time which at this juncture was not\r\n    available. A thorough inspection would have involved washing\r\n    and cleansing the back, and this is not practical in treating\r\n    an acutely injured patient. You have to determine which things,\r\n    which are immediately life threatening and cope with them,\r\n    before attempting to evaluate the full extent of the injuries.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you ever have occasion to look at the President\u2019s back?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir. Before--well, in trying to treat an acutely injured\r\n    patient, you have to establish an airway, adequate ventilation\r\n    and you have to establish adequate circulation. Before this was\r\n    accomplished the President\u2019s cardiac activity had ceased and\r\n    closed cardiac massage was instituted, which made it impossible\r\n    to inspect his back.\r\n\r\n    Q. Was any effort made to inspect the President\u2019s back after he\r\n    had expired?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. And why was no effort made at that time to inspect his back?\r\n\r\n\r\n    A. I suppose nobody really had the heart to do it.[C2-222]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Parkland doctors took no further action after the\r\nPresident had expired because they concluded that it was beyond the\r\nscope of their permissible duties.[C2-223]\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of Governor Connally\r\n\r\nWhile one medical team tried to revive President Kennedy, a second\r\nperformed a series of operations on the bullet wounds sustained by\r\nGovernor Connally.[C2-224] Governor Connally was originally seen by Dr.\r\nCarrico and Dr. Richard Dulany.", "start_char_idx": 186123, "end_char_idx": 190469, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cec4c85d-7889-4424-b4e2-0a3d7983997e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cec4c85d-7889-4424-b4e2-0a3d7983997e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a2d4878-0d92-455e-994f-864508e363cd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "c5c69d0ebab56950b43efdf3f94e76865048a8b89c6a1e49e22d80e59e68b1ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9259513f-3082-4e8b-9ff9-962428be3d33", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "acefbcbc1064743f8c9e90791b615eeb63873508d3535004fb97d19944e5ef6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Before this was\r\n    accomplished the President\u2019s cardiac activity had ceased and\r\n    closed cardiac massage was instituted, which made it impossible\r\n    to inspect his back.\r\n\r\n    Q.

Rubber\r\ntubes were inserted between the second and third ribs to reexpand the\r\nright lung, which had collapsed because of the opening in the chest\r\nwall.[C2-228] At 1:35 p.m., after Governor Connally had been moved to\r\nthe operating room, Dr. Shaw started the first operation by cutting\r\naway the edges of the wound on the front of the Governor\u2019s chest and\r\nsuturing the damaged lung and lacerated muscles.[C2-229] The elliptical\r\nwound in the Governor\u2019s back, located slightly to the left of the\r\nGovernor\u2019s right armpit approximately five-eighths inch (a centimeter\r\nand a half) in its greatest diameter, was treated by cutting away\r\nthe damaged skin and suturing the back muscle and skin.[C2-230] This\r\noperation was concluded at 3:20 p.m.[C2-231]\r\n\r\nTwo additional operations were performed on Governor Connally for\r\nwounds which he had not realized he had sustained until he regained\r\nconsciousness the following day.[C2-232] From approximately 4 p.m. to\r\n4:50 p.m. on November 22, Dr. Charles F. Gregory, chief of orthopedic\r\nsurgery, operated on the wounds of Governor Connally\u2019s right wrist,\r\nassisted by Drs. William Osborne and John Parker.[C2-233] The wound on\r\nthe back of the wrist was left partially open for draining, and the\r\nwound on the palm side was enlarged, cleansed, and closed. The fracture\r\nwas set, and a cast was applied with some traction utilized.[C2-234]\r\nWhile the second operation was in progress, Dr. George T. Shires,\r\nassisted by Drs. Robert McClelland, Charles Baxter, and Ralph Don\r\nPatman, treated the gunshot wound in the left thigh.[C2-235] This\r\npunctuate missile wound, about two-fifths inch in diameter (1\r\ncentimeter) and located approximately 5 inches above the left knee,\r\nwas cleansed and closed with sutures; but a small metallic fragment\r\nremained in the Governor\u2019s leg.[C2-236]\r\n\r\n\r\nVice President Johnson at Parkland\r\n\r\nAs President Kennedy and Governor Connally were being removed from the\r\nlimousine onto stretchers, a protective circle of Secret Service agents\r\nsurrounded Vice President and Mrs. Johnson and escorted them into\r\nParkland Hospital through the emergency entrance.[C2-237] The agents\r\nmoved a nurse and patient out of a nearby room, lowered the shades, and\r\ntook emergency security measures to protect the Vice President.[C2-238]\r\nTwo men from the President\u2019s followup car were detailed to help\r\nprotect the Vice President.

Secret Service agents working with police\r\ncleared the areas adjacent to the aircraft, including warehouses,\r\nother terminal buildings and the neighboring parking lots, of all\r\npeople.[C2-254] The agents decided not to shift the Presidential\r\naircraft to the far side of the airport because the original landing\r\narea was secure and a move would require new measures.[C2-255]\r\n\r\nWhen security arrangements at the airport were complete, the Secret\r\nService made the necessary arrangements for the Vice President to leave\r\nthe hospital. Unmarked police cars took the Vice President and Mrs.\r\nJohnson from Parkland Hospital to Love Field. Chief Curry drove one\r\nautomobile occupied by Vice President Johnson, U.S. Representatives\r\nThomas and Thornberry, and Special Agent Youngblood. In another car\r\nMrs. Johnson was driven to the airport accompanied by Secret Service\r\nagents and Representative Brooks. Motorcycle policemen who escorted the\r\nautomobiles were requested by the Vice President and Agent Youngblood\r\nnot to use sirens. During the drive Vice President Johnson, at\r\nYoungblood\u2019s instruction, kept below window level.[C2-256]\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoval of the President\u2019s Body\r\n\r\nWhile the team of doctors at Parkland Hospital tried desperately to\r\nsave the life of President Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy alternated between\r\nwatching them and waiting outside.[C2-257] After the President was\r\npronounced dead, O\u2019Donnell tried to persuade Mrs. Kennedy to leave the\r\narea, but she refused. She said that she intended to stay with her\r\nhusband.[C2-258] A casket was obtained and the President\u2019s body was\r\nprepared for removal.[C2-259] Before the body could be taken from the\r\nhospital, two Dallas officials informed members of the President\u2019s\r\nstaff that the body could not be removed from the city until an autopsy\r\nwas performed. Despite the protests of these officials, the casket was\r\nwheeled out of the hospital, placed in an ambulance, and transported to\r\nthe airport shortly after 2 p.m.[C2-260] At approximately 2:15 p.m. the\r\ncasket was loaded, with some difficulty because of the narrow airplane\r\ndoor, onto the rear of the Presidential plane where seats had been\r\nremoved to make room.[C2-261] Concerned that the local officials might\r\ntry to prevent the plane\u2019s departure, O\u2019Donnell asked that the pilot\r\ntake off immediately. He was informed that takeoff would be delayed\r\nuntil Vice President Johnson was sworn in.[C2-262]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE TRIP\r\n\r\nSwearing in of the New President\r\n\r\nFrom the Presidential airplane, the Vice President telephoned Attorney\r\nGeneral Robert F. Kennedy, who advised that Mr. Johnson take the\r\nPresidential oath of office before the plane left Dallas.[C2-263]\r\nFederal Judge Sarah T. Hughes hastened to the plane to administer the\r\noath.[C2-264] Members of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential parties\r\nfilled the central compartment of the plane to witness the swearing in.\r\nAt 2:38 p.m., c.s.t., Lyndon Baines Johnson took the oath of office as\r\nthe 36th President of the United States.[C2-265] Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs.\r\nJohnson stood at the side of the new President as he took the oath of\r\noffice.[C2-266] Nine minutes later, the Presidential airplane departed\r\nfor Washington, D.C.[C2-267]\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn to Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nOn the return flight, Mrs. Kennedy sat with David Powers, Kenneth\r\nO\u2019Donnell, and Lawrence O\u2019Brien.[C2-268] At 5:58 p.m., e.s.t.,\r\n_Air Force One_ landed at Andrews AFB, where President Kennedy had\r\nbegun his last trip only 31 hours before.[C2-269] Detailed security\r\narrangements had been made by radio from the President\u2019s plane on the\r\nreturn flight.[C2-270] The public had been excluded from the base,\r\nand only Government officials and the press were permitted near the\r\nlanding area.", "start_char_idx": 196351, "end_char_idx": 200630, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31ac704a-a5c6-48a9-bfda-6e811cf9ea91": {"__data__": {"id_": "31ac704a-a5c6-48a9-bfda-6e811cf9ea91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe95cbc1-80f9-4bc8-a5b9-9c9f1f141d3e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "665552275bcc443980f053318874299f1e84c8c90eea996f09e4e3119ec0d3d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "37c414c2-76d9-4a08-b581-abe51b5211f1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "22e48ea13bd8023526ac79b1c99db84ab6370e9057ed3fcff89513780a44a146", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C2-265] Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs.\r\nJohnson stood at the side of the new President as he took the oath of\r\noffice.[C2-266] Nine minutes later, the Presidential airplane departed\r\nfor Washington, D.C.[C2-267]\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn to Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nOn the return flight, Mrs. Kennedy sat with David Powers, Kenneth\r\nO\u2019Donnell, and Lawrence O\u2019Brien.[C2-268] At 5:58 p.m., e.s.t.,\r\n_Air Force One_ landed at Andrews AFB, where President Kennedy had\r\nbegun his last trip only 31 hours before.[C2-269] Detailed security\r\narrangements had been made by radio from the President\u2019s plane on the\r\nreturn flight.[C2-270] The public had been excluded from the base,\r\nand only Government officials and the press were permitted near the\r\nlanding area.

The body was muscular and well developed with no gross skeletal\r\nabnormalities except for those caused by the gunshot wounds. Under\r\n\u201cPathological Diagnosis\u201d the cause of death was set forth as \u201cGunshot\r\nwound, head.\u201d[C2-279] (See app. IX.)\r\n\r\nThe autopsy examination revealed two wounds in the President\u2019s head.\r\nOne wound, approximately one-fourth of an inch by five-eighths of an\r\ninch (6 by 15 millimeters), was located about an inch (2.5 centimeters)\r\nto the right and slightly above the large bony protrusion (external\r\noccipital protuberance) which juts out at the center of the lower part\r\nof the back of the skull. The second head wound measured approximately\r\n5 inches (13 centimeters) in its greatest diameter, but it was\r\ndifficult to measure accurately because multiple crisscross fractures\r\nradiated from the large defect.[C2-280] During the autopsy examination,\r\nFederal agents brought the surgeons three pieces of bone recovered from\r\nElm Street and the Presidential automobile. When put together, these\r\nfragments accounted for approximately three-quarters of the missing\r\nportion of the skull.[C2-281] The surgeons observed, through X-ray\r\nanalysis, 30 or 40 tiny dustlike fragments of metal running in a line\r\nfrom the wound in the rear of the President\u2019s head toward the front\r\npart of the skull, with a sizable metal fragment lying just above the\r\nright eye.[C2-282] From this head wound two small irregularly shaped\r\nfragments of metal were recovered and turned over to the FBI.[C2-283]\r\n\r\nThe autopsy also disclosed a wound near the base of the back of\r\nPresident Kennedy\u2019s neck slightly to the right of his spine. The\r\ndoctors traced the course of the bullet through the body and, as\r\ninformation was received from Parkland Hospital, concluded that the\r\nbullet had emerged from the front portion of the President\u2019s neck that\r\nhad been cut away by the tracheotomy at Parkland.", "start_char_idx": 199902, "end_char_idx": 204064, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37c414c2-76d9-4a08-b581-abe51b5211f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "37c414c2-76d9-4a08-b581-abe51b5211f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "31ac704a-a5c6-48a9-bfda-6e811cf9ea91", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "6d5c3664ac9a3f6e2720a3b72dd9669038d630f6ecc91a58f0383cb1c8ba71c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e551c298-e7d8-496a-a786-0879158b1b71", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c282ab5ab9e7c56c60a33fd9f25008605473220a8159c656ac8184b99484e2fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C2-281] The surgeons observed, through X-ray\r\nanalysis, 30 or 40 tiny dustlike fragments of metal running in a line\r\nfrom the wound in the rear of the President\u2019s head toward the front\r\npart of the skull, with a sizable metal fragment lying just above the\r\nright eye.[C2-282] From this head wound two small irregularly shaped\r\nfragments of metal were recovered and turned over to the FBI.[C2-283]\r\n\r\nThe autopsy also disclosed a wound near the base of the back of\r\nPresident Kennedy\u2019s neck slightly to the right of his spine.

In that connection the Commission has evaluated (1) the\r\ntestimony of eyewitnesses present at the scene of the assassination;\r\n(2) the damage to the Presidential limousine; (3) the examination by\r\nqualified experts of the rifle and cartridge cases found on the sixth\r\nfloor of the Texas School Book Depository and the bullet fragments\r\nfound in the Presidential limousine and at Parkland Hospital; (4)\r\nthe wounds suffered by President Kennedy and Governor Connally; (5)\r\nwound ballistics tests; (6) the examination by qualified experts of\r\nthe clothing worn by President Kennedy and Governor Connally; and (7)\r\nmotion-picture films and still photographs taken at the time of the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WITNESSES\r\n\r\nAs reflected in the previous chapter, passengers in the first few cars\r\nof the motorcade had the impression that the shots came from the rear\r\nand from the right, the general direction of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building, although none of these passengers saw anyone\r\nfire the shots. Some spectators at Houston and Elm Streets, however,\r\ndid see a rifle being fired in the direction of the President\u2019s car\r\nfrom the easternmost window of the sixth floor on the south side of\r\nthe building. Other witnesses saw a rifle in this window immediately\r\nafter the assassination. Three employees of the Depository, observing\r\nthe parade from the fifth floor, heard the shots fired from the floor\r\nimmediately above them. No credible evidence suggests that the shots\r\nwere fired from the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass, the\r\nnearby railroad yards or any place other than the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 477\r\n\r\nPosition of Howard L.

Soon\r\nafter the President\u2019s car passed, he heard an explosion like the\r\nbackfire of a motorcycle.[C3-7] Brennan recalled:\r\n\r\n    Well, then something, just right after this explosion, made me\r\n    think that it was a firecracker being thrown from the Texas\r\n    Book Store. And I glanced up. And this man that I saw previous\r\n    was aiming for his last shot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Well, as it appeared to me he was standing up and resting\r\n    against the left window sill, with gun shouldered to his\r\n    right shoulder, holding the gun with his left hand and taking\r\n    positive aim and fired his last shot. As I calculate a couple\r\n    of seconds. He drew the gun back from the window as though he\r\n    was drawing it back to his side and maybe paused for another\r\n    second as though to assure hisself that he hit his mark, and\r\n    then he disappeared.[C3-8]\r\n\r\nBrennan stated that he saw 70 to 85 percent of the gun when it was\r\nfired and the body of the man from the waist up.[C3-9] The rifle was\r\naimed southwesterly down Elm Street toward the underpass.[C3-10]\r\nBrennan saw the man fire one shot and he remembered hearing a total\r\nof only two shots. When questioned about the number of shots, Brennan\r\ntestified:\r\n\r\n    I don\u2019t know what made me think that there was firecrackers\r\n    throwed out of the Book Store unless I did hear the second\r\n    shot, because I positively thought the first shot was a\r\n    backfire, and subconsciously I must have heard a second shot,\r\n    but I do not recall it. I could not swear to it.[C3-11]\r\n\r\nBrennan quickly reported his observations to police officers.[C3-12]\r\nBrennan\u2019s description of the man he saw is discussed in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nAmos Lee Euins, a 15-year-old ninth grade student, stated that he was\r\nfacing the Depository as the motorcade turned the corner at Elm and\r\nHouston. He recalled:\r\n\r\n    Then I was standing here, and as the motorcade turned the\r\n    corner, I was facing, looking dead at the building. And so I\r\n    seen this pipe thing sticking out the window. I wasn\u2019t paying\r\n    too much attention to it.

Harold was sitting\r\n    next to me, and he said it came right from over our head.[C3-46]\r\n\r\nWilliams testified Norman said \u201cI can even hear the shell being ejected\r\nfrom the gun hitting the floor.\u201d[C3-47]\r\n\r\nWhen Jarman heard the first sound, he thought that it was either a\r\nbackfire--\r\n\r\n    * * * or an officer giving a salute to the President. And then\r\n    at that time I didn\u2019t, you know, think too much about it. * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Well, after the third shot was fired, I think I got up and\r\n    I run over to Harold Norman and Bonnie Ray Williams, and\r\n    told them, I said, I told them that it wasn\u2019t a backfire or\r\n    anything, that somebody was shooting at the President.[C3-48]\r\n\r\nJarman testified that Norman said \u201cthat he thought the shots had come\r\nfrom above us, and I noticed that Bonnie Ray had a few debris in his\r\nhead. It was sort of white stuff, or something.\u201d[C3-49] Jarman stated\r\nthat Norman said \u201cthat he was sure that the shot came from inside the\r\nbuilding because he had been used to guns and all that, and he said\r\nit didn\u2019t sound like it was too far off anyway.\u201d[C3-50] The three men\r\nran to the west side of the building, where they could look toward the\r\nTriple Underpass to see what had happened to the motorcade.[C3-51]\r\n\r\nAfter the men had gone to the window on the west side of the building,\r\nJarman \u201cgot to thinking about all the debris on Bonnie Ray\u2019s head\u201d and\r\nsaid, \u201cThat shot probably did come from upstairs, up over us.\u201d[C3-52]\r\nHe testified that Norman said, \u201cI know it did, because I could hear\r\nthe action of the bolt, and I could hear the cartridges drop on the\r\nfloor.\u201d[C3-53] After pausing for a few minutes, the three men ran\r\ndownstairs. Norman and Jarman ran out of the front entrance of the\r\nbuilding, where they saw Brennan, the construction worker who had seen\r\nthe man in the window firing the gun, talking to a police officer, and\r\nthey then reported their own experience.[C3-54]\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 1964, preceding their appearance before the Commission,\r\nthese witnesses were interviewed in Dallas. At that time members of the\r\nCommission\u2019s legal staff conducted an experiment. Norman, Williams,\r\nand Jarman placed themselves at the windows of the fifth floor as they\r\nhad been on November 22. A Secret Service agent operated the bolt of\r\na rifle directly above them at the southeast corner window of the\r\nsixth floor. At the same time, three cartridge shells were dropped to\r\nthe floor at intervals of about 3 seconds. According to Norman, the\r\nnoise outside was less on the day of the assassination than on the day\r\nof the test.[C3-55] He testified, \u201cWell, I heard the same sound, the\r\nsound similar. I heard three something that he dropped on the floor and\r\nthen I could hear the rifle or whatever he had up there.\u201d[C3-56] The\r\nexperiment with the shells and rifle was repeated for members of the\r\nCommission on May 9, 1964, on June 7, 1964, and again on September 6,\r\n1964. All seven of the Commissioners clearly heard the shells drop to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Triple Underpass\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the testimony of the witnesses who heard and observed\r\nshots fired from the Depository, the Commission\u2019s investigation has\r\ndisclosed no credible evidence that any shots were fired from anywhere\r\nelse. When the shots were fired, many people near the Depository\r\nbelieved that the shots came from the railroad bridge over the Triple\r\nUnderpass or from the area to the west of the Depository.[C3-57] In\r\nthe hectic moments after the assassination, many spectators ran in\r\nthe general direction of the Triple Underpass or the railroad yards\r\nnorthwest of the building.", "start_char_idx": 219433, "end_char_idx": 223452, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e6f6cf1-4621-40ea-bb22-d13edc845f6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e6f6cf1-4621-40ea-bb22-d13edc845f6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "590ff572-c041-4ec3-add3-355a5ab3bf48", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "73fde63eac1d84446209e4ea6794ad13bb959d9554f63693d80527876dc322f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c7a437bb-d9f1-4860-aaaf-3fdeb342e206", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "659d2f9fa85602455ca406298090cc4f4cfbb359abc56aea60c65f56a3995a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "All seven of the Commissioners clearly heard the shells drop to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Triple Underpass\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the testimony of the witnesses who heard and observed\r\nshots fired from the Depository, the Commission\u2019s investigation has\r\ndisclosed no credible evidence that any shots were fired from anywhere\r\nelse.

Some were running toward the place from\r\nwhich the sound of the rifle fire appeared to come, others were fleeing\r\nthe scene of the shooting.[C3-58] None of these people saw anyone with\r\na rifle, and the Commission\u2019s inquiry has yielded no evidence that\r\nshots were fired from the bridge over the Triple Underpass or from the\r\nrailroad yards.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the motorcade, Patrolman J.\u00a0W. Foster stood on the east\r\nside of the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass and Patrolman\r\nJ.\u00a0C. White stood on the west side.[C3-59] Patrolman Joe E. Murphy\r\nwas standing over Elm Street on the Stemmons Freeway overpass, west\r\nof the railroad bridge farther away from the Depository.[C3-60] Two\r\nother officers were stationed on Stemmons Freeway to control traffic\r\nas the motorcade entered the Freeway.[C3-61] Under the advance\r\npreparations worked out between the Secret Service and the Dallas\r\nPolice Department, the policemen were under instructions to keep\r\n\u201cunauthorized\u201d people away from these locations.[C3-62] When the\r\nmotorcade reached the intersection of Elm and Houston Streets, there\r\nwere no spectators on Stemmons Freeway where Patrolman Murphy was\r\nstationed.[C3-63] Patrolman Foster estimated that there were 10 or 11\r\npeople on the railroad bridge where he was assigned;[C3-64] another\r\nwitness testified that there were between 14 and 18 people there as the\r\nmotorcade came into view.[C3-65] Investigation has disclosed 15 persons\r\nwho were on the railroad bridge at this time, including 2 policemen,\r\n2 employees of the Texas-Louisiana Freight Bureau and 11 employees of\r\nthe Union Terminal Co.[C3-66] In the absence of any explicit definition\r\nof \u201cunauthorized\u201d persons, the policemen permitted these employees to\r\nremain on the railroad bridge to watch the motorcade. (See chapter\r\nVIII, pp. 446-447.) At the request of the policemen, S.M. Holland,\r\nsignal supervisor for Union Terminal Co., came to the railroad bridge\r\nat about 11:45 a.m. and remained to identify those persons who were\r\nrailroad employees.[C3-67] In addition, Patrolman Foster checked\r\ncredentials to determine if persons seeking access to the bridge were\r\nrailroad employees.[C3-68] Persons who were not railroad employees were\r\nordered away, including one news photographer who wished only to take a\r\npicture of the motorcade.[C3-69]\r\n\r\nAnother employee of the Union Terminal Co., Lee E. Bowers, Jr., was at\r\nwork in a railroad tower about 14 feet above the tracks to the north\r\nof the railroad bridge and northwest of the corner of Elm and Houston,\r\napproximately 50 yards from the back of the Depository.[C3-70] (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 2218, p. 73.) From the tower he could view\r\npeople moving in the railroad yards and at the rear of the Depository.\r\nAccording to Bowers, \u201cSince approximately 10 o\u2019clock in the morning\r\ntraffic had been cut off into the area so that anyone moving around\r\ncould actually be observed.\u201d[C3-71] During the 20 minutes prior to\r\nthe arrival of the motorcade, Bowers noticed three automobiles which\r\nentered his immediate area; two left without discharging any passengers\r\nand the third was apparently on its way out when last observed by\r\nBowers.[C3-72] Bowers observed only three or four people in the general\r\narea, as well as a few bystanders on the railroad bridge over the\r\nTriple Underpass.[C3-73]\r\n\r\nAs the motorcade proceeded toward the Triple Underpass, the spectators\r\nwere clustered together along the east concrete wall of the railroad\r\nbridge facing the oncoming procession.[C3-74] (See Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 2215, p. 75.)", "start_char_idx": 222764, "end_char_idx": 227016, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7a437bb-d9f1-4860-aaaf-3fdeb342e206": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7a437bb-d9f1-4860-aaaf-3fdeb342e206", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e6f6cf1-4621-40ea-bb22-d13edc845f6e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "90deb7b3357e2982bf2dffbc525fe18634e04db142d3abdc55eb420efe6172e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a5fb070-5180-4dc6-93a8-a47877de144e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7ec20cf113fe7278c286f197e8301002b3232e531e3e5d32039fea07c8d72737", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "According to Bowers, \u201cSince approximately 10 o\u2019clock in the morning\r\ntraffic had been cut off into the area so that anyone moving around\r\ncould actually be observed.\u201d[C3-71] During the 20 minutes prior to\r\nthe arrival of the motorcade, Bowers noticed three automobiles which\r\nentered his immediate area; two left without discharging any passengers\r\nand the third was apparently on its way out when last observed by\r\nBowers.[C3-72] Bowers observed only three or four people in the general\r\narea, as well as a few bystanders on the railroad bridge over the\r\nTriple Underpass.[C3-73]\r\n\r\nAs the motorcade proceeded toward the Triple Underpass, the spectators\r\nwere clustered together along the east concrete wall of the railroad\r\nbridge facing the oncoming procession.[C3-74] (See Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 2215, p. 75.) Patrolman Foster stood immediately behind them and\r\ncould observe all of them.[C3-75] Secret Service agents in the lead car\r\nof the motorcade observed the bystanders and the police officer on the\r\nbridge.[C3-76] Special Agent Winston G. Lawson motioned through the\r\nwindshield in an unsuccessful attempt to instruct Patrolman Foster to\r\nmove the people away from their position directly over the path of the\r\nmotorcade.[C3-77] Some distance away, on the Stemmons Freeway overpass\r\nabove Elm Street, Patrolman Murphy also had the group on the railroad\r\nbridge within view.[C3-78] When he heard the shots, Foster rushed to\r\nthe wall of the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass and looked\r\ntoward the street.[C3-79] After the third shot, Foster ran toward the\r\nDepository and shortly thereafter informed Inspector Herbert J.

Austin L. Miller, employed by the\r\nTexas-Louisiana Freight Bureau, heard three shots and thought that they\r\ncame from the area of the Presidential limousine itself.[C3-81] One of\r\nhis coworkers, Royce G. Skelton, thought he heard four shots, but could\r\nnot tell their exact source.[C3-82] Frank E. Reilly, an electrician\r\nat Union Terminal, heard three shots which seemed to come from the\r\ntrees \u201cOn the north side of Elm Street at the corner up there.\u201d[C3-83]\r\nAccording to S.M. Holland, there were four shots which sounded as\r\nthough they came from the trees on the north side of Elm Street where\r\nhe saw a puff of smoke.[C3-84] Thomas J. Murphy, a mail foreman at\r\nUnion Terminal Co., heard two shots and said that they came from a\r\nspot just west of the Depository.[C3-85] In the railroad tower, Bowers\r\nheard three shots, which sounded as though they came either from the\r\nDepository Building or near the mouth of the Triple Underpass. Prior\r\nto November 22, 1963, Bowers had noted the similarity of the sounds\r\ncoming from the vicinity of the Depository and those from the Triple\r\nUnderpass, which he attributed to \u201ca reverberation which takes place\r\nfrom either location.\u201d[C3-86]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the shots were fired, neither the policemen nor\r\nthe spectators on the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass saw\r\nanything suspicious on the bridge in their vicinity.

Holland, for example, immediately after the\r\nshots, ran off the overpass to see if there was anyone behind the\r\npicket fence on the north side of Elm Street, but he did not see anyone\r\namong the parked cars.[C3-88] Miller did not see anyone running across\r\nthe railroad tracks or on the plaza west of the Depository.[C3-89]\r\nBowers and others saw a motorcycle officer dismount hurriedly and\r\ncome running up the incline on the north side of Elm Street.[C3-90]\r\nThe motorcycle officer, Clyde A. Haygood, saw no one running from the\r\nrailroad yards.[C3-91]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL AUTOMOBILE\r\n\r\nAfter the Presidential car was returned to Washington on November 22,\r\n1963, Secret Service agents found two bullet fragments in the front\r\nseat. One fragment, found on the seat beside the driver, weighed 44.6\r\ngrains and consisted of the nose portion of a bullet.[C3-92] The\r\nother fragment, found along the right side of the front seat, weighed\r\n21.0 grains and consisted of the base portion of a bullet.[C3-93]\r\nDuring the course of an examination on November 23, agents of the\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation found three small lead particles,\r\nweighing between seven-tenths and nine-tenths of a grain each, on the\r\nrug underneath the left jump seat which had been occupied by Mrs.\r\nConnally.[C3-94] During this examination, the Bureau agents noted a\r\nsmall residue of lead on the inside surface of the laminated windshield\r\nand a very small pattern of cracks on the outer layer of the windshield\r\nimmediately behind the lead residue.[C3-95] There was a minute particle\r\nof glass missing from the outside surface, but no penetration. The\r\ninside layer of glass was not broken.[C3-96] The agents also observed a\r\ndent in the strip of chrome across the top of the windshield, located\r\nto the left of the rear view mirror support.[C3-97]\r\n\r\nThe lead residue on the inside of the windshield was compared under\r\nspectrographic analysis by FBI experts with the bullet fragments\r\nfound on and alongside the front seat and with the fragments under\r\nthe left jump seat. It was also compared with bullet fragments found\r\nat Parkland Hospital. All these bullet fragments were found to be\r\nsimilar in metallic composition, but it was not possible to determine\r\nwhether two or more of the fragments came from the same bullet.[C3-98]\r\nIt is possible for the fragments from the front seat to have been a\r\npart of the same bullet as the three fragments found near the left\r\njump seat,[C3-99] since a whole bullet of this type weighs 160-161\r\ngrains.[C3-100] (See app. X, pp. 555-558.)\r\n\r\nThe physical characteristics of the windshield after the assassination\r\ndemonstrate that the windshield was struck on the inside surface.

A nearly whole bullet was\r\ndiscovered on the stretcher used to carry Governor Connally at Parkland\r\nHospital. As described in the preceding section, five bullet fragments\r\nwere found in the President\u2019s limousine. The cartridge cases, the\r\nnearly whole bullet and the bullet fragments were all subjected to\r\nfirearms identification analysis by qualified experts. It was the\r\nunanimous opinion of the experts that the nearly whole bullet, the two\r\nlargest bullet fragments and the three cartridge cases were definitely\r\nfired in the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building\r\nto the exclusion of all other weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscovery of Cartridge Cases and Rifle\r\n\r\nShortly after the assassination, police officers arrived at the\r\nDepository Building and began a search for the assassin and\r\nevidence.[C3-108] Around 1 p.m. Deputy Sheriff Luke Mooney noticed a\r\npile of cartons in front of the window in the southeast corner of the\r\nsixth floor.[C3-109] (See Commission Exhibit No. 723, p. 80.) Searching\r\nthat area he found at approximately 1:12 p.m. three empty cartridge\r\ncases on the floor near the window.[C3-110] When he was notified of\r\nMooney\u2019s discovery, Capt. J.\u00a0W. Fritz, chief of the homicide bureau of\r\nthe Dallas Police Department, issued instructions that nothing be moved\r\nor touched until technicians from the police crime laboratory could\r\ntake photographs and check for fingerprints.[C3-111] Mooney stood guard\r\nto see that nothing was disturbed.[C3-112] A few minutes later, Lt.\r\nJ.\u00a0C.

After his arrival at\r\nthe hospital the Governor was brought into trauma room No. 2 on a\r\nstretcher, removed from the room on that stretcher a short time later,\r\nand taken on an elevator to the second-floor operating room.[C3-119] On\r\nthe second floor he was transferred from the stretcher to an operating\r\ntable which was then moved into the operating room, and a hospital\r\nattendant wheeled the empty stretcher into an elevator.[C3-120] Shortly\r\nafterward, Darrell C. Tomlinson, the hospital\u2019s senior engineer,\r\nremoved this stretcher from the elevator and placed it in the corridor\r\non the ground floor, alongside another stretcher wholly unconnected\r\nwith the care of Governor Connally.[C3-121] A few minutes later, he\r\nbumped one of the stretchers against the wall and a bullet rolled\r\nout.[C3-122]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 723\r\n\r\nShield of cartons around sixth floor southeast corner window.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Tomlinson was not certain whether the bullet came from the\r\nConnally stretcher or the adjacent one, the Commission has concluded\r\nthat the bullet came from the Governor\u2019s stretcher. That conclusion is\r\nbuttressed by evidence which eliminated President Kennedy\u2019s stretcher\r\nas a source of the bullet. President Kennedy remained on the stretcher\r\non which he was carried into the hospital while the doctors tried to\r\nsave his life.[C3-123] He was never removed from the stretcher from the\r\ntime he was taken into the emergency room until his body was placed\r\nin a casket in that same room.[C3-124] After the President\u2019s body\r\nwas removed from that stretcher, the linen was taken off and placed\r\nin a hamper and the stretcher was pushed into trauma room No. 2, a\r\ncompletely different location from the site where the nearly whole\r\nbullet was found.[C3-125]\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Rifle\r\n\r\nThe bolt-action, clip-fed rifle found on the sixth floor of the\r\nDepository, described more fully in appendix X, is inscribed with\r\nvarious markings, including \u201cMADE ITALY,\u201d \u201cCAL. 6.5,\u201d \u201c1940\u201d and the\r\nnumber C2766.[C3-126] (See Commission Exhibit Nos. 1303, 541(2) and\r\n541(3), pp. 82-83.)

As a weapon is\r\nused further distinctive markings are introduced. Under microscopic\r\nexamination a qualified expert may be able to determine whether the\r\nmarkings on a bullet known to have been fired in a particular weapon\r\nand the markings on a suspect bullet are the same and, therefore,\r\nwhether both bullets were fired in the same weapon to the exclusion\r\nof all other weapons. Similarly, firearms identification experts are\r\nable to compare the markings left upon the base of cartridge cases and\r\nthereby determine whether both cartridges were fired by the same weapon\r\nto the exclusion of all other weapons. According to Frazier, such\r\nan identification \u201cis made on the presence of sufficient individual\r\nmicroscopic characteristics so that a very definite pattern is formed\r\nand visualized on the two surfaces.\u201d[C3-140] Under some circumstances,\r\nas where the bullet or cartridge case is seriously mutilated, there are\r\nnot sufficient individual characteristics to enable the expert to make\r\na firm identification.[C3-141]\r\n\r\nAfter making independent examinations, both Frazier and Nicol\r\npositively identified the nearly whole bullet from the stretcher and\r\nthe two larger bullet fragments found in the Presidential limousine as\r\nhaving been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the\r\nDepository to the exclusion of all other weapons.[C3-142] Each of the\r\ntwo bullet fragments had sufficient unmutilated area to provide the\r\nbasis for an identification.[C3-143] However, it was not possible to\r\ndetermine whether the two bullet fragments were from the same bullet\r\nor from two different bullets.[C3-144] With regard to the other bullet\r\nfragments discovered in the limousine and in the course of treating\r\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally, however, expert examination\r\ncould demonstrate only that the fragments were \u201csimilar in metallic\r\ncomposition\u201d to each other, to the two larger fragments and to the\r\nnearly whole bullet.[C3-145] After examination of the three cartridge\r\ncases found on the sixth floor of the Depository, Frazier and Nicol\r\nconcluded that they had been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano\r\nrifle to the exclusion of all other weapons.[C3-146] Two other experts\r\nfrom the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who made independent\r\nexaminations of the nearly whole bullet, bullet fragments and cartridge\r\ncases, reached the identical conclusions.[C3-147]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BULLET WOUNDS\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of the source of the shots fired at\r\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally, the Commission has also\r\nevaluated the expert medical testimony of the doctors who observed\r\nthe wounds during the emergency treatment at Parkland Hospital and\r\nduring the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital.

The cut reflected\r\na larger dimension of entry than the bullet\u2019s diameter of 6.5\r\nmillimeters, since the missile, in effect, sliced along the skull for\r\na fractional distance until it entered.[C3-150] The dimension of 6\r\nmillimeters, somewhat smaller than the diameter of a 6.5-millimeter\r\nbullet, was caused by the elastic recoil of the skull which shrinks the\r\nsize of an opening after a missile passes through it.[C3-151]\r\n\r\nLt. Col. Pierre A. Finck, Chief of the Wound Ballistics Pathology\r\nBranch of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, who has\r\nhad extensive experience with bullet wounds, illustrated the\r\ncharacteristics which led to his conclusions about the head wound by\r\na chart prepared by him. This chart, based on Colonel Finck\u2019s studies\r\nof more than 400 cases, depicted the effect of a perforating missile\r\nwound on the human skull.[C3-152] When a bullet enters the skull\r\n(cranial vault) at one point and exits at another, it causes a beveling\r\nor cratering effect where the diameter of the hole is smaller on the\r\nimpact side than on the exit side. Based on his observations of that\r\nbeveling effect on the President\u2019s skull, Colonel Finck testified:\r\n\u201cPresident Kennedy was, in my opinion, shot from the rear. The bullet\r\nentered in the back of the head and went out on the right side of his\r\nskull * * * he was shot from above and behind.\u201d[C3-153]\r\n\r\nComdr. James J. Humes, senior pathologist and director of laboratories\r\nat the Bethesda Naval Hospital, who acted as chief autopsy surgeon,\r\nconcurred in Colonel Finck\u2019s analysis. He compared the beveling or\r\nconing effect to that caused by a BB shot which strikes a pane of\r\nglass, causing a round or oval defect on the side of the glass where\r\nthe missile strikes and a belled-out or coned-out surface on the\r\nopposite side of the glass.[C3-154] Referring to the bullet hole on the\r\nback of President Kennedy\u2019s head, Commander Humes testified: \u201cThe wound\r\non the inner table, however, was larger and had what in the field of\r\nwound ballistics is described as a shelving or coning effect.\u201d[C3-155]\r\nAfter studying the other hole in the President\u2019s skull, Commander Humes\r\nstated: \u201c* * * we concluded that the large defect to the upper right\r\nside of the skull, in fact, would represent a wound of exit.\u201d[C3-156]\r\nThose characteristics led Commander Humes and Comdr. J. Thornton\r\nBoswell, chief of pathology at Bethesda Naval Hospital, who assisted\r\nin the autopsy, to conclude that the bullet penetrated the rear of the\r\nPresident\u2019s head and exited through a large wound on the right side of\r\nhis head.[C3-157]\r\n\r\nBallistics experiments (discussed more fully in app. X, pp.", "start_char_idx": 245954, "end_char_idx": 250224, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d28d0461-910f-4d30-af2e-e1bb573ec960": {"__data__": {"id_": "d28d0461-910f-4d30-af2e-e1bb573ec960", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8149d0fa-efb8-4908-9be3-038854072095", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "f79f89d589bb43e56dd3a849967471e89450b3f851d3d350678074779d62d0c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b768ee9-a87f-462a-ab3e-4e5a2527717c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7006c1028d9cf8a0d953ecaccaec2eb985df554bc791f94ee5777807713a7dee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "J.

The Wound Ballistics Branch of\r\nthe U.S. Army laboratories at Edgewood Arsenal, Md., conducted an\r\nextensive series of experiments to test the effect of Western Cartridge\r\nCo. 6.5-millimeter bullets, the type found on Governor Connally\u2019s\r\nstretcher and in the Presidential limousine, fired from the C2766\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the Depository. The Edgewood Arsenal\r\ntests were performed under the immediate supervision of Alfred G.\r\nOlivier, a doctor who had spent 7 years in wounds ballistics research\r\nfor the U.S. Army.[C3-158]\r\n\r\nOne series of tests, performed on reconstructed inert human skulls,\r\ndemonstrated that the President\u2019s head wound could have been caused\r\nby the rifle and bullets fired by the assassin from the sixth-floor\r\nwindow. The results of this series were illustrated by the findings on\r\none skull which was struck at a point closely approximating the wound\r\nof entry on President Kennedy\u2019s head. That bullet blew out the right\r\nside of the reconstructed skull in a manner very similar to the head\r\nwound of the President.[C3-159] As a result of these tests, Dr. Olivier\r\nconcluded that a Western Cartridge Co. 6.5 bullet fired from the C2766\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle at a distance of 90 yards would make the same\r\ntype of wound as that found on the President\u2019s head. Referring to the\r\nseries of tests, Dr. Olivier testified:\r\n\r\n    It disclosed that the type of head wounds that the President\r\n    received could be done by this type of bullet. This surprised\r\n    me very much, because this type of stable bullet I didn\u2019t\r\n    think would cause a massive head wound, I thought it would go\r\n    through making a small entrance and exit, but the bones of the\r\n    skull are enough to deform the end of this bullet causing it to\r\n    expend a lot of energy and blowing out the side of the skull or\r\n    blowing out fragments of the skull.[C3-160]\r\n\r\nAfter examining the fragments of the bullet which struck the\r\nreconstructed skull, Dr. Olivier stated that--\r\n\r\n    the recovered fragments were very similar to the ones recovered\r\n    on the front seat and on the floor of the car.\r\n\r\n    This, to me, indicates that those fragments did come from the\r\n    bullet that wounded the President in the head.[C3-161]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President\u2019s Neck Wounds\r\n\r\nDuring the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital another bullet wound\r\nwas observed near the base of the back of President Kennedy\u2019s neck\r\nslightly to the right of his spine which provides further enlightenment\r\nas to the source of the shots. The hole was located approximately 5\u00bd\r\ninches (14 centimeters) from the tip of the right shoulder joint and\r\napproximately the same distance below the tip of the right mastoid\r\nprocess, the bony point immediately behind the ear.[C3-162] The\r\nwound was approximately one-fourth by one-seventh of an inch (7 by\r\n4 millimeters), had clean edges, was sharply delineated, and had\r\nmargins similar in all respects to those of the entry wound in the\r\nskull.[C3-163] Commanders Humes and Boswell agreed with Colonel Finck\u2019s\r\ntestimony that this hole--\r\n\r\n    * * * is a wound of entrance. * * * The basis for that\r\n    conclusion is that this wound was relatively small with clean\r\n    edges. It was not a jagged wound, and that is what we see in\r\n    wound of entrance at a long range.[C3-164]\r\n\r\nThe autopsy examination further disclosed that, after entering the\r\nPresident, the bullet passed between two large muscles, produced a\r\ncontusion on the upper part of the pleural cavity (without penetrating\r\nthat cavity), bruised the top portion of the right lung and ripped the\r\nwindpipe (trachea) in its path through the President\u2019s neck.[C3-165]\r\nThe examining surgeons concluded that the wounds were caused by the\r\nbullet rather than the tracheotomy performed at Parkland Hospital.", "start_char_idx": 249917, "end_char_idx": 254140, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b768ee9-a87f-462a-ab3e-4e5a2527717c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b768ee9-a87f-462a-ab3e-4e5a2527717c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d28d0461-910f-4d30-af2e-e1bb573ec960", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce2424f4af7d956c57f25e43a314f58a59284d331b62c05ddc64dcfb77a527f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2db62508-488c-4183-aea1-22cc05955e5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b98c100df7c68c4aaf405bd2e534652a4232ccb10d125ed7964de8f068508e0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C3-163] Commanders Humes and Boswell agreed with Colonel Finck\u2019s\r\ntestimony that this hole--\r\n\r\n    * * * is a wound of entrance. * * * The basis for that\r\n    conclusion is that this wound was relatively small with clean\r\n    edges.

In the earlier stages of the autopsy, the surgeons\r\nwere unable to find a path into any large muscle in the back of the\r\nneck. At that time they did not know that there had been a bullet\r\nhole in the front of the President\u2019s neck when he arrived at Parkland\r\nHospital because the tracheotomy incision had completely eliminated\r\nthat evidence.[C3-169] While the autopsy was being performed, surgeons\r\nlearned that a whole bullet had been found at Parkland Hospital on\r\na stretcher which, at that time, was thought to be the stretcher\r\noccupied by the President. This led to speculation that the bullet\r\nmight have penetrated a short distance into the back of the neck and\r\nthen dropped out onto the stretcher as a result of the external heart\r\nmassage.[C3-170]\r\n\r\nFurther exploration during the autopsy disproved that theory. The\r\nsurgeons determined that the bullet had passed between two large strap\r\nmuscles and bruised them without leaving any channel, since the bullet\r\nmerely passed between them.[C3-171] Commander Humes, who believed\r\nthat a tracheotomy had been performed from his observations at the\r\nautopsy, talked by telephone with Dr. Perry early on the morning of\r\nNovember 23, and learned that his assumption was correct and that Dr.\r\nPerry had used the missile wound in the neck as the point to make the\r\nincision.[C3-172] This confirmed the Bethesda surgeons\u2019 conclusion that\r\nthe bullet had exited from the front part of the neck.\r\n\r\nThe findings of the doctors who conducted the autopsy were consistent\r\nwith the observations of the doctors who treated the President at\r\nParkland Hospital. Dr. Charles S. Carrico, a resident surgeon at\r\nParkland, noted a small wound approximately one-fourth of an inch in\r\ndiameter (5 to 8 millimeters) in the lower third of the neck below\r\nthe Adam\u2019s apple.[C3-173] Dr. Malcolm O.

Carrico, a resident surgeon at\r\nParkland, noted a small wound approximately one-fourth of an inch in\r\ndiameter (5 to 8 millimeters) in the lower third of the neck below\r\nthe Adam\u2019s apple.[C3-173] Dr. Malcolm O. Perry, who performed the\r\ntracheotomy, described the wound as approximately one-fifth of an inch\r\nin diameter (5 millimeters) and exuding blood which partially hid edges\r\nthat were \u201cneither cleancut, that is, punched out, nor were they very\r\nragged.\u201d[C3-174] Dr. Carrico testified as follows:\r\n\r\n    Q. Based on your observations on the neck wound alone did you\r\n    have a sufficient basis to form an opinion as to whether it was\r\n    an entrance or an exit wound?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir; we did not. Not having completely evaluated all\r\n    the wounds, traced out the course of the bullets, this wound\r\n    would have been compatible with either entrance or exit wound\r\n    depending upon the size, the velocity, the tissue structure and\r\n    so forth.[C3-175]\r\n\r\nThe same response was made by Dr. Perry to a similar query:\r\n\r\n    Q. Based on the appearance of the neck wound alone, could it\r\n    have been either an entrance or an exit wound?\r\n\r\n    A. It could have been either.[C3-176]\r\n\r\nThen each doctor was asked to take into account the other known facts,\r\nsuch as the autopsy findings, the approximate distance the bullet\r\ntraveled and tested muzzle velocity of the assassination weapon. With\r\nthese additional factors, the doctors commented on the wound on the\r\nfront of the President\u2019s neck as follows:\r\n\r\n    Dr. CARRICO. With those facts and the fact as I understand it\r\n    no other bullet was found this would be, this was, I believe,\r\n    was an exit wound.[C3-177]\r\n\r\n    Dr. PERRY. A full jacketed bullet without deformation passing\r\n    through skin would leave a similar wound for an exit and\r\n    entrance wound and with the facts which you have made available\r\n    and with these assumptions, I believe that it was an exit\r\n    wound.[C3-178]\r\n\r\nOther doctors at Parkland Hospital who observed the wound prior to\r\nthe tracheotomy agreed with the observations of Drs. Perry and\r\nCarrico.[C3-179] The bullet wound in the neck could be seen for only\r\na short time, since Dr. Perry eliminated evidence of it when he\r\nperformed the tracheotomy. He selected that spot since it was the point\r\nwhere such an operation was customarily performed, and it was one\r\nof the safest and easiest spots from which to reach the trachea. In\r\naddition, there was possibly an underlying wound to the muscles in the\r\nneck, the carotid artery or the jugular vein, and Dr. Perry concluded\r\nthat the incision, therefore, had to be low in order to maintain\r\nrespiration.[C3-180]\r\n\r\nConsiderable confusion has arisen because of comments attributed to\r\nDr. Perry concerning the nature of the neck wound. Immediately after\r\nthe assassination, many people reached erroneous conclusions about the\r\nsource of the shots because of Dr. Perry\u2019s observations to the press.\r\nOn the afternoon of November 22, a press conference was organized\r\nat Parkland Hospital by members of the White House press staff and\r\na hospital administrator. Newsmen with microphones and cameras were\r\ncrowded into a room to hear statements by Drs. Perry and William\r\nKemp Clark, chief neurosurgeon at Parkland, who had attended to\r\nPresident Kennedy\u2019s head injury. Dr. Perry described the situation as\r\n\u201cbedlam.\u201d[C3-181] The confusion was compounded by the fact that some\r\nquestions were only partially answered before other questions were\r\nasked.[C3-182]\r\n\r\nAt the news conference, Dr. Perry answered a series of hypothetical\r\nquestions and stated to the press that a variety of possibilities\r\ncould account for the President\u2019s wounds. He stated that a single\r\nbullet could have caused the President\u2019s wounds by entering through\r\nthe throat, striking the spine, and being deflected upward with the\r\npoint of exit being through the head.[C3-183] This would have accounted\r\nfor the two wounds he observed, the hole in the front of the neck and\r\nthe large opening in the skull.

At that time, Dr. Perry did not know\r\nabout either the wound on the back of the President\u2019s neck or the small\r\nbullet-hole wound in the back of the head. As described in chapter\r\nII, the President was lying on his back during his entire time at\r\nParkland. The small hole in the head was also hidden from view by the\r\nlarge quantity of blood which covered the President\u2019s head. Dr. Perry\r\nsaid his answers at the press conference were intended to convey his\r\ntheory about what could have happened, based on his limited knowledge\r\nat the time, rather than his professional opinion about what did\r\nhappen.[C3-184] Commenting on his answers at the press conference, Dr.\r\nPerry testified before the Commission:\r\n\r\n    I expressed it [his answers] as a matter of speculation that\r\n    this was conceivable. But, again, Dr. Clark [who also answered\r\n    questions at the conference] and I emphasized that we had no\r\n    way of knowing.[C3-185]\r\n\r\nDr. Perry\u2019s recollection of his comments is corroborated by some of the\r\nnews stories after the press conference. The New York Herald Tribune on\r\nNovember 23, 1963, reported as follows:\r\n\r\n     Dr. Malcolm Perry, 34, attendant surgeon at Parkland Hospital\r\n    who attended the President, said he saw two wounds--one below\r\n    the Adam\u2019s apple, the other at the back of the head. He said he\r\n    did not know if two bullets were involved. It is possible, he\r\n    said, that the neck wound was the entrance and the other the\r\n    exit of the missile.[C3-186]\r\n\r\nAccording to this report, Dr. Perry stated merely that it was\r\n\u201cpossible\u201d that the neck wound was a wound of entrance. This conforms\r\nwith his testimony before the Commission, where he stated that by\r\nthemselves the characteristics of the neck wound were consistent with\r\nbeing either a point of entry or exit.\r\n\r\n_Wound ballistics tests._--Experiments performed by the Army Wound\r\nBallistics experts at Edgewood Arsenal, Md. (discussed in app. X, p.\r\n582) showed that under simulated conditions entry and exit wounds are\r\nvery similar in appearance. After reviewing the path of the bullet\r\nthrough the President\u2019s neck, as disclosed in the autopsy report,\r\nthe experts simulated the neck by using comparable material with a\r\nthickness of approximately 5\u00bd inches (13\u00bd to 14\u00bd centimeters), which\r\nwas the distance traversed by the bullet. Animal skin was placed on\r\neach side, and Western Cartridge Co. 6.5 bullets were fired from the\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle from a distance of 180 feet. The animal\r\nskin on the entry side showed holes which were regular and round.\r\nOn the exit side two holes were only slightly elongated, indicating\r\nthat the bullet had become only a little unstable at the point of\r\nexit.[C3-187] A third exit hole was round, although not quite as\r\nregular as the entry holes.[C3-188] The exit holes, especially the\r\none most nearly round, appeared similar to the descriptions given by\r\nDrs. Perry and Carrico of the hole in the front of the President\u2019s\r\nneck.[C3-189]\r\n\r\nThe autopsy disclosed that the bullet which entered the back of the\r\nPresident\u2019s neck hit no bony structure and proceeded in a slightly\r\ndownward angle. The markings on the President\u2019s clothing indicate\r\nthat the bullet moved in a slight right to left lateral direction as\r\nit passed through the President\u2019s body.", "start_char_idx": 259939, "end_char_idx": 264081, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a58d4fbd-daa8-43aa-b4cd-93ecea5c8aac": {"__data__": {"id_": "a58d4fbd-daa8-43aa-b4cd-93ecea5c8aac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "29f15e54-d482-4a95-90b4-4fed39648d38", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "6444c0592a63d804ff8efd7dd929e79aac2c7bcd7fb8a60e53f86a7e9565349a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d1c0cfd-4497-46c2-bb1c-63e2891f0f68", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "771b8a827a7a7fbb3c6575d65172c1425e9186a5d128abf75f9a1e5532b3c411", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The animal\r\nskin on the entry side showed holes which were regular and round.\r\nOn the exit side two holes were only slightly elongated, indicating\r\nthat the bullet had become only a little unstable at the point of\r\nexit.[C3-187] A third exit hole was round, although not quite as\r\nregular as the entry holes.[C3-188] The exit holes, especially the\r\none most nearly round, appeared similar to the descriptions given by\r\nDrs.

The entrance velocity of the\r\nbullet fired from the rifle averaged 1,904 feet per second after it\r\ntraveled 180 feet. The exit velocity averaged 1,772 to 1,798 feet per\r\nsecond, depending upon the substance through which the bullet passed.\r\nA photograph of the path of the bullet traveling through the simulated\r\nneck showed that it proceeded in a straight line and was stable.[C3-192]\r\n\r\n_Examination of clothing._--The clothing worn by President Kennedy on\r\nNovember 22 had holes and tears which showed that a missile entered\r\nthe back of his clothing in the vicinity of his lower neck and exited\r\nthrough the front of his shirt immediately behind his tie, nicking the\r\nknot of his tie in its forward flight.[C3-193] Although the caliber\r\nof the bullet could not be determined and some of the clothing items\r\nprecluded a positive determination that some tears were made by a\r\nbullet, all the defects could have been caused by a 6.5-millimeter\r\nbullet entering the back of the President\u2019s lower neck and exiting in\r\nthe area of the knot of his tie.[C3-194]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the suit jacket worn by the President by FBI Agent\r\nFrazier revealed a roughly circular hole approximately one-fourth of\r\nan inch in diameter on the rear of the coat, 5\u215c inches below the top\r\nof the collar and 1\u00be inches to the right of the center back seam of\r\nthe coat.[C3-195] The hole was visible on the upper rear of the coat\r\nslightly to the right of center. Traces of copper were found in the\r\nmargins of the hole and the cloth fibers around the margins were pushed\r\ninward.[C3-196] Those characteristics established that the hole was\r\ncaused by an entering bullet.[C3-197] Although the precise size of the\r\nbullet could not be determined from the hole, it was consistent with\r\nhaving been made by a 6.5-millimeter bullet.[C3-198]\r\n\r\nThe shirt worn by the President contained a hole on the back side 5\u00be\r\ninches below the top of the collar and 1\u215b inches to the right of the\r\nmiddle of the back of the shirt.[C3-199] The hole on the rear of the\r\nshirt was approximately circular in shape and about one-fourth of an\r\ninch in diameter, with the fibers pressed inward.[C3-200] These factors\r\nestablished it as a bullet entrance hole.[C3-201] The relative position\r\nof the hole in the back of the suit jacket to the hole in the back\r\nof the shirt indicated that both were caused by the same penetrating\r\nmissile.[C3-202]\r\n\r\nOn the front of the shirt, examination revealed a hole seven-eighths\r\nof an inch below the collar button and a similar opening seven-eighths\r\nof an inch below the buttonhole. These two holes fell into alinement\r\non overlapping positions when the shirt was buttoned.[C3-203] Each\r\nhole was a vertical, ragged slit approximately one-half of an inch\r\nin height, with the cloth fibers protruding outward.

Although the\r\ncharacteristics of the slit established that the missile had exited\r\nto the front, the irregular nature of the slit precluded a positive\r\ndetermination that it was a bullet hole.[C3-204] However, the hole\r\ncould have been caused by a round bullet although the characteristics\r\nwere not sufficiently clear to enable the examining expert to render a\r\nconclusive opinion.[C3-205]\r\n\r\nWhen the President\u2019s clothing was removed at Parkland Hospital, his tie\r\nwas cut off by severing the loop immediately to the wearer\u2019s left of\r\nthe knot, leaving the knot in its original condition.[C3-206] The tie\r\nhad a nick on the left side of the knot.[C3-207] The nick was elongated\r\nhorizontally, indicating that the tear was made by some object moving\r\nhorizontally, but the fibers were not affected in a manner which would\r\nshed light on the direction or the nature of the missile.[C3-208]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Governor\u2019s Wounds\r\n\r\nWhile riding in the right jump seat of the Presidential limousine\r\non November 22, Governor Connally sustained wounds of the back,\r\nchest, right wrist and left thigh. Because of the small size and\r\nclean-cut edges of the wound on the Governor\u2019s back, Dr. Robert Shaw\r\nconcluded that it was an entry wound.[C3-209] The bullet traversed\r\nthe Governor\u2019s chest in a downward angle, shattering his fifth rib,\r\nand exited below the right nipple.[C3-210] The ragged edges of the\r\n2-inch (5 centimeters) opening on the front of the chest led Dr. Shaw\r\nto conclude that it was the exit point of the bullet.[C3-211] When\r\nGovernor Connally testified before the Commission 5 months after\r\nthe assassination, on April 21, 1964, the Commission observed the\r\nGovernor\u2019s chest wounds, as well as the injuries to his wrist and thigh\r\nand watched Dr. Shaw measure with a caliper an angle of declination of\r\n25\u00b0 from the point of entry on the back to the point of exit on the\r\nfront of the Governor\u2019s chest.[C3-212]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the shooting, Governor Connally was unaware that he had\r\nsustained any injuries other than his chest wounds.[C3-213] On the back\r\nof his arm, about 2 inches (5 centimeters) above the wrist joint on\r\nthe thumb side, Dr. Charles F. Gregory observed a linear perforating\r\nwound approximately one-fifth of an inch (one-half centimeter) wide\r\nand 1 inch (2\u00bd centimeters) long.[C3-214] During his operation on this\r\ninjury, the doctor concluded that this ragged wound was the point of\r\nentry because thread and cloth had been carried into the wound to the\r\nregion of the bone.[C3-215] Dr. Gregory\u2019s conclusions were also based\r\nupon the location in the Governor\u2019s wrist, as revealed by X-ray, of\r\nsmall fragments of metal shed by the missile upon striking the firm\r\nsurface of the bone.[C3-216] Evidence of different amounts of air in\r\nthe tissues of the wrist gave further indication that the bullet passed\r\nfrom the back to the front of the wrist.[C3-217] An examination of the\r\npalm surface of the wrist showed a wound approximately one-fifth of\r\nan inch (one-half centimeter) long and approximately three-fourths of\r\nan inch (2 centimeters) above the crease of the right wrist.[C3-218]\r\nDr. Shaw had initially believed that the missile entered on the palm\r\nside of the Governor\u2019s wrist and exited on the back side.[C3-219]\r\nAfter reviewing the factors considered by Dr. Gregory, however, Dr.\r\nShaw withdrew his earlier opinion.

On\r\nthe back of the Governor\u2019s coat, a hole was found 1\u215b inches from\r\nthe seam where the right sleeve attached to the coat and 7\u00bc inches\r\nto the right of the midline.[C3-225] This hole was elongated in a\r\nhorizontal direction approximately five-eighths of an inch in length\r\nand one-fourth of an inch in height.[C3-226] The front side of the\r\nGovernor\u2019s coat contained a circular hole three-eighths of an inch in\r\ndiameter, located 5 inches to the right of the front right edge of the\r\ncoat slightly above the top button.[C3-227] A rough hole approximately\r\nfive-eighths of an inch in length and three-eighths of an inch in width\r\nwas found near the end of the right sleeve.[C3-228] Each of these holes\r\ncould have been caused by a bullet, but a positive determination of\r\nthis fact or the direction of the missile was not possible because the\r\ngarment had been cleaned and pressed prior to any opportunity for a\r\nscientific examination.[C3-229]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the Governor\u2019s shirt disclosed a very ragged tear\r\nfive-eighths of an inch long horizontally and one-half of an inch\r\nvertically on the back of the shirt near the right sleeve 2 inches\r\nfrom the line where the sleeve attaches.[C3-230] Immediately to the\r\nright was another small tear, approximately three-sixteenths of an inch\r\nlong.[C3-231] The two holes corresponded in position to the hole in\r\nthe back of the Governor\u2019s coat.[C3-232] A very irregular tear in the\r\nform of an \u201cH\u201d was observed on the front side of the Governor\u2019s shirt,\r\napproximately 1\u00bd inches high, with a crossbar tear approximately 1 inch\r\nwide, located 5 inches from the right side seam and 9 inches from

had first traversed his chest. The Army Wound\r\nBallistics experts conducted tests which proved that the Governor\u2019s\r\nwrist wound was not caused by a pristine bullet. (See app. X, pp.\r\n582-585.) A bullet is pristine immediately on exiting from a rifle\r\nmuzzle when it moves in a straight line with a spinning motion and\r\nmaintains its uniform trajectory with but a minimum of nose surface\r\nstriking the air through which it passes.[C3-240] When the straight\r\nline of flight of a bullet is deflected by striking some object, it\r\nstarts to wobble or become irregular in flight, a condition called\r\nyaw.[C3-241] A bullet with yaw has a greater surface exposed to the\r\nstriking material or air, since the target or air is struck not only\r\nby the nose of the bullet, its smallest striking surface, but also by\r\nthe bullet\u2019s sides.[C3-242]\r\n\r\nThe ballistics experts learned the exact nature of the Governor\u2019s wrist\r\nwound by examining Parkland Hospital records and X-rays and conferring\r\nwith Dr. Gregory. The C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the\r\nDepository was fired with bullets of the same type as the bullet found\r\non the Governor\u2019s stretcher and the fragments found in the Presidential\r\nlimousine. Shots were fired from a distance of 70 yards at comparable\r\nflesh and bone protected by material similar to the clothing worn by\r\nthe Governor.[C3-243] One of the test shots wounded the comparable\r\nflesh and bone structure in virtually the same place and from the same\r\nangle as the wound inflicted on Governor Connally\u2019s wrist.

The weight of the whole\r\nbullet prior to firing was approximately 160-161 grains and that of the\r\nrecovered bullet was 158.6 grains.[C3-253] An X-ray of the Governor\u2019s\r\nwrist showed very minute metallic fragments, and two or three of these\r\nfragments were removed from his wrist.[C3-254] All these fragments were\r\nsufficiently small and light so that the nearly whole bullet found on\r\nthe stretcher could have deposited those pieces of metal as it tumbled\r\nthrough his wrist.[C3-255] In their testimony, the three doctors who\r\nattended Governor Connally at Parkland Hospital expressed independently\r\ntheir opinion that a single bullet had passed through his chest;\r\ntumbled through his wrist with very little exit velocity, leaving small\r\nmetallic fragments from the rear portion of the bullet; punctured his\r\nleft thigh after the bullet had lost virtually all of its velocity; and\r\nhad fallen out of the thigh wound.[C3-256]\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally himself thought it likely that all his wounds were\r\ncaused by a single bullet.

In order to determine the facts with as much\r\nprecision as possible and to insure that all data were consistent\r\nwith the shots having been fired from the sixth floor window, the\r\nCommission requested additional investigation, including the analysis\r\nof motion picture films of the assassination and onsite tests. The\r\nfacts developed through this investigation by the FBI and Secret\r\nService confirmed the conclusions reached by the Commission regarding\r\nthe source and trajectory of the shots which hit the President and the\r\nGovernor. Moreover, these facts enabled the Commission to make certain\r\napproximations regarding the locations of the Presidential limousine at\r\nthe time of the shots and the relevant time intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFilms and Tests\r\n\r\nWhen the shots rang out the Presidential limousine was moving beyond\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository Building in a southwesterly direction\r\non Elm Street between Houston Street and the Triple Underpass.[C3-260]\r\nThe general location of the car was described and marked on maps by\r\neyewitnesses as precisely as their observations and recollections\r\npermitted.[C3-261] More exact information was provided by motion\r\npictures taken by Abraham Zapruder, Orville O. Nix and Mary Muchmore,\r\nwho were spectators at the scene.[C3-262] Substantial light has been\r\nshed on the assassination sequence by viewing these motion pictures,\r\nparticularly the Zapruder film, which was the most complete and from\r\nwhich individual 35-millimeter slides were made of each motion picture\r\nframe.[C3-263]\r\n\r\nExamination of the Zapruder motion picture camera by the FBI\r\nestablished that 18.3 pictures or frames were taken each second,\r\nand therefore, the timing of certain events could be calculated by\r\nallowing 1/18.3 seconds for the action depicted from one frame to the\r\nnext.[C3-264] The films and slides made from individual frames were\r\nviewed by Governor and Mrs. Connally, the Governor\u2019s doctors, the\r\nautopsy surgeons, and the Army wound ballistics scientists in order\r\nto apply the knowledge of each to determine the precise course of\r\nevents.[C3-265] Tests of the assassin\u2019s rifle disclosed that at least\r\n2.3 seconds were required between shots.[C3-266] In evaluating the\r\nfilms in the light of these timing guides, it was kept in mind that\r\na victim of a bullet wound may not react immediately and, in some\r\nsituations, according to experts, the victim may not even know where he\r\nhas been hit, or when.[C3-267]\r\n\r\nOn May 24, 1964, agents of the FBI and Secret Service conducted a\r\nseries of tests to determine as precisely as possible what happened\r\non November 22, 1963. Since the Presidential limousine was being\r\nremodeled and was therefore unavailable, it was simulated by using\r\nthe Secret Service followup car, which is similar in design.[C3-268]\r\nAny differences were taken into account.

The pictures or frames in the Zapruder film were marked\r\nby the agents, with the number \u201c1\u201d given to the first frame where\r\nthe motorcycles leading the motorcade came into view on Houston\r\nStreet.[C3-273] The numbers continue in sequence as Zapruder filmed\r\nthe Presidential limousine as it came around the corner and proceeded\r\ndown Elm. The President was in clear view of the assassin as he rode up\r\nHouston Street and for 100 feet as he proceeded down Elm Street, until\r\nhe came to a point denoted as frame 166 on the Zapruder film.[C3-274]\r\nThese facts were determined in the test by placing the car and men\r\non Elm Street in the exact spot where they were when each frame of\r\nthe Zapruder film was photographed. To pinpoint their locations, a\r\nman stood at Zapruder\u2019s position and directed the automobile and both\r\nmodels to the positions shown on each frame, after which a Bureau\r\nphotographer crouched at the sixth-floor window and looked through a\r\ncamera whose lens recorded the view through the telescopic sight of the\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.[C3-275] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n887, p. 99.)

However, the assassin continued to\r\nhave a clear view of the President as he proceeded down Elm.[C3-282]\r\nWhen President Kennedy again came fully into view in the Zapruder film\r\nat frame 225, he seemed to be reacting to his neck wound by raising\r\nhis hands to his throat.[C3-283] (See Commission Exhibit No. 895, p.\r\n103.)

It is also doubtful\r\nthat even the most proficient marksman would have hit him through the\r\noak tree. In addition, the President\u2019s reaction is \u201cbarely apparent\u201d\r\nin frame 225, which is 15 frames or approximately eight-tenths second\r\nafter frame 210, and a shot much before 210 would assume a longer\r\nreaction time than was recalled by eyewitnesses at the scene. Thus,\r\nthe evidence indicated that the President was not hit until at least\r\nframe 210 and that he was probably hit by frame 225. The possibility\r\nof variations in reaction time in addition to the obstruction of\r\nZapruder\u2019s view by the sign precluded a more specific determination\r\nthan that the President was probably shot through the neck between\r\nframes 210 and 225, which marked his position between 138.9 and 153.8\r\nfeet west of station C.[C3-285]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 887\r\n\r\nPhotograph taken during reenactment showing C2766 rifle with camera\r\nattached.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 889\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 166]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 891\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 186]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 893\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 210]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 895\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 225]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 697\r\n\r\nPhotograph of Presidential limousine taken during motorcade.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Special Agent Robert A.

Frazier, who occupied the position\r\nof the assassin in the sixth-floor window during the reenactment,\r\nit is likely that the bullet which passed through the President\u2019s\r\nneck, as described previously, then struck the automobile or someone\r\nelse in the automobile.[C3-286] The minute examination by the FBI\r\ninspection team, conducted in Washington between 14 and 16 hours\r\nafter the assassination, revealed no damage indicating that a bullet\r\nstruck any part of the interior of the Presidential limousine, with\r\nthe exception of the cracking of the windshield and the dent on the\r\nwindshield chrome.[C3-287] Neither of these points of damage to the car\r\ncould have been caused by the bullet which exited from the President\u2019s\r\nneck at a velocity of 1,772 to 1,779 feet per second.[C3-288] If the\r\ntrajectory had permitted the bullet to strike the windshield, the\r\nbullet would have penetrated it and traveled a substantial distance\r\ndown the road unless it struck some other object en route.[C3-289] Had\r\nthat bullet struck the metal framing, which was dented, it would have\r\ntorn a hole in the chrome and penetrated the framing, both inside and\r\noutside the car.[C3-290] At that exit velocity, the bullet would have\r\npenetrated any other metal or upholstery surface of the interior of the\r\nautomobile.[C3-291]\r\n\r\nThe bullet that hit President Kennedy in the back and exited through\r\nhis throat most likely could not have missed both the automobile\r\nand its occupants. Since it did not hit the automobile, Frazier\r\ntestified that it probably struck Governor Connally.[C3-292] The\r\nrelative positions of President Kennedy and Governor Connally at\r\nthe time when the President was struck in the neck confirm that the\r\nsame bullet probably passed through both men. Pictures taken of the\r\nPresident\u2019s limousine on November 22, 1963, showed that the Governor\r\nsat immediately in front of the President.[C3-293] Even though the\r\nprecise distance cannot be ascertained, it is apparent that President\r\nKennedy was somewhat to the Governor\u2019s right. The President sat on the\r\nextreme right, as noted in the films and by eyewitnesses, while the\r\nright edge of the jump seat in which the Governor sat is 6 inches from\r\nthe right door.[C3-294] (See Commission Exhibit No. 697, p. 104.) The\r\nPresident wore a back brace which tended to make him sit up straight,\r\nand the Governor also sat erect since the jump seat gave him little leg\r\nroom.[C3-295]\r\n\r\nBased on his observations during the reenactment and the position of\r\nGovernor Connally shown in the Zapruder film after the car emerged\r\nfrom behind the sign, Frazier testified that Governor Connally was in\r\na position during the span from frame 207 to frame 225 to receive a\r\nbullet which would have caused the wounds he actually suffered.[C3-296]\r\nGovernor Connally viewed the film and testified that he was hit between\r\nframes 231 and 234.[C3-297] According to Frazier, between frames 235\r\nand 240 the Governor turned sharply to his right, so that by frame\r\n240 he was too far to the right to have received his injuries at that\r\ntime.[C3-298] At some point between frames 235 and 240, therefore,\r\nis the last occasion when Governor Connally could have received his\r\ninjuries, since in the frames following 240 he remained turned too\r\nfar to his right.", "start_char_idx": 289336, "end_char_idx": 293054, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5d0a361-3af7-4e3e-b252-a517f6662e66": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5d0a361-3af7-4e3e-b252-a517f6662e66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c224c84a-230b-4776-bdd9-df5bb47172f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ad861ed12d5708b6022a7ad615f666cf731c837f7297008f6f20bd217ad4be9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "94363ee6-ebaa-4fee-96f6-e5daf8cff161", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f38c4e0af5b3cce5d40fcd3ef688fd2955e8cd43ff5fd1a69642f8093971df35", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C3-296]\r\nGovernor Connally viewed the film and testified that he was hit between\r\nframes 231 and 234.[C3-297] According to Frazier, between frames 235\r\nand 240 the Governor turned sharply to his right, so that by frame\r\n240 he was too far to the right to have received his injuries at that\r\ntime.[C3-298] At some point between frames 235 and 240, therefore,\r\nis the last occasion when Governor Connally could have received his\r\ninjuries, since in the frames following 240 he remained turned too\r\nfar to his right.[C3-299] If Governor Connally was hit by a separate\r\nshot between frames 235 and 240 which followed the shot which hit the\r\nPresident\u2019s neck, it would follow that: (1) the assassin\u2019s first shot,\r\nassuming a minimum firing time of 2.3 seconds (or 42 frames), was fired\r\nbetween frames 193 and 198 when his view was obscured by the oak tree;\r\n(2) President Kennedy continued waving to the crowd after he was hit\r\nand did not begin to react for about 1\u00bd seconds; and (3) the first\r\nshot, although hitting no bones in the President\u2019s body, was deflected\r\nafter its exit from the President\u2019s neck in such a way that it failed\r\nto hit either the automobile or any of the other occupants.\r\n\r\nViewed through the telescopic sight of the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano\r\nrifle from the sixth-floor window during the test, the marks that\r\nsimulated the entry wounds on the stand-ins for the President and the\r\nGovernor were generally in a straight line. That alinement became\r\nobvious to the viewer through the scope as the Governor\u2019s model\r\nturned slightly to his right and assumed the position which Governor\r\nConnally had described as his position when he was struck. Viewing\r\nthe stand-ins for the President and the Governor in the sight of the\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle at the location depicted in frames\r\n207 and 210, Frazier testified: \u201cThey both are in direct alinement\r\nwith the telescopic sight at the window. The Governor is immediately\r\nbehind the President in the field of view.\u201d[C3-300] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 893, p. 102.) A surveyor then placed his sighting equipment\r\nat the precise point of entry on the back of the President\u2019s neck,\r\nassuming that the President was struck at frame 210, and measured the\r\nangle to the end of the muzzle of the rifle positioned where it was\r\nbelieved to have been held by the assassin.[C3-301] That angle measured\r\n21\u00b034\u2019.[C3-302] From the same points of reference, the angle at frame\r\n225 was measured at 20\u00b011\u2019, giving an average angle of 20\u00b052\u201930\u201d from\r\nframe 210 to frame 225.[C3-303] Allowing for a downward street grade of\r\n3\u00b09\u2019, the probable angle through the President\u2019s body was calculated at\r\n17\u00b043\u201930\u201d, assuming that he was sitting in a vertical position.[C3-304]\r\n\r\nThat angle was consistent with the trajectory of a bullet passing\r\nthrough the President\u2019s neck and then striking Governor Connally\u2019s\r\nback, causing the wounds which were discussed above. Shortly after\r\nthat angle was ascertained, the open car and the stand-ins were\r\ntaken by the agents to a nearby garage where a photograph was taken\r\nto determine through closer study whether the angle of that shot\r\ncould have accounted for the wounds in the President\u2019s neck and the\r\nGovernor\u2019s back.[C3-305] A rod was placed at an angle of 17\u00b043\u201930\u201d next\r\nto the stand-ins for the President and the Governor, who were seated in\r\nthe same relative positions.[C3-306] The wounds of entry and exit on\r\nthe President were approximated based on information gained from the\r\nautopsy reports and photographs.[C3-307] The hole in the back of the\r\njacket worn by the Governor and the medical description of the wound\r\non his back marked that entry point.[C3-308] That line of fire from\r\nthe sixth floor of the Depository would have caused the bullet to exit\r\nunder the Governor\u2019s right nipple just as the bullet did.

Governor\r\nConnally\u2019s doctors measured an angle of declination on his body from\r\nthe entry wound on his back to the exit on the front of his chest at\r\nabout 25\u00b0 when he sat erect.[C3-309] That difference was explained\r\nby either a slight deflection of the bullet caused by striking the\r\nfifth rib or the Governor\u2019s leaning slightly backward at the time he\r\nwas struck. In addition, the angle could not be fixed with absolute\r\nprecision, since the large wound on the front of his chest precluded an\r\nexact determination of the point of exit.[C3-310]\r\n\r\nThe alinement of the points of entry was only indicative and not\r\nconclusive that one bullet hit both men. The exact positions of\r\nthe men could not be re-created; thus, the angle could only be\r\napproximated.[C3-311] Had President Kennedy been leaning forward or\r\nbackward, the angle of declination of the shot to a perpendicular\r\ntarget would have varied. The angle of 17\u00b043\u201930\u201d was approximately\r\nthe angle of declination reproduced in an artist\u2019s drawing.[C3-312]\r\nThat drawing, made from data provided by the autopsy surgeons, could\r\nnot reproduce the exact line of the bullet, since the exit wound\r\nwas obliterated by the tracheotomy. Similarly, if the President or\r\nthe Governor had been sitting in a different lateral position, the\r\nconclusion might have varied. Or if the Governor had not turned in\r\nexactly the way calculated, the alinement would have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nAdditional experiments by the Army Wound Ballistics Branch further\r\nsuggested that the same bullet probably passed through both President\r\nKennedy and Governor Connally. (See app. X, pp. 582-585.) Correlation\r\nof a test simulating the Governor\u2019s chest wound with the neck and\r\nwrist experiments indicated that course. After reviewing the Parkland\r\nHospital medical records and X-rays of the Governor and discussing his\r\nchest injury with the attending surgeon, the Army ballistics experts\r\nvirtually duplicated the wound using the assassination weapon and\r\nanimal flesh covered by cloth.[C3-313] The bullet that struck the\r\nanimal flesh displayed characteristics similar to the bullet found on\r\nGovernor Connally\u2019s stretcher.[C3-314] Moreover, the imprint on the\r\nvelocity screen immediately behind the animal flesh showed that the\r\nbullet was tumbling after exiting from the flesh, having lost a total\r\naverage of 265 feet per second.[C3-315] Taking into consideration the\r\nGovernor\u2019s size, the reduction in velocity of a bullet passing through\r\nhis body would be approximately 400 feet per second.[C3-316]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 902\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM NIX FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 313\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM MUCHMORE FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT]\r\n\r\nBased upon the medical evidence on the wounds of the Governor and\r\nthe President and the wound ballistics tests performed at Edgewood\r\nArsenal, Drs.

Dziemian and Olivier believed that\r\nthe wound on the Governor\u2019s wrist would have been more extensive had\r\nthe bullet which inflicted that injury merely passed through the\r\nGovernor\u2019s chest, exiting at a velocity of approximately 1,500 feet per\r\nsecond.[C3-319] Thus, the Governor\u2019s wrist wound suggested that the\r\nbullet passed through the President\u2019s neck, began to yaw in the air\r\nbetween the President and the Governor, and then lost more velocity\r\nthan 400 feet per second in passing through the Governor\u2019s chest. A\r\nbullet which was yawing on entering into the Governor\u2019s back would\r\nlose substantially more velocity in passing through his body than\r\na pristine bullet.[C3-320] In addition, the bullet that struck the\r\nanimal flesh was flattened to a greater extent than the bullet which\r\npresumably struck the Governor\u2019s rib,[C3-321] which suggests that the\r\nbullet which entered the Governor\u2019s chest had already lost velocity\r\nby passing through the President\u2019s neck. Moreover, the large wound on\r\nthe Governor\u2019s back would be explained by a bullet which was yawing,\r\nalthough that type of wound might also be accounted for by a tangential\r\nstriking.[C3-322]\r\n\r\nDr. Frederick W. Light, Jr., the third of the wound ballistics experts,\r\nwho has been engaged in that specialty at Edgewood Arsenal since 1951,\r\ntestified that the anatomical findings were insufficient for him to\r\nformulate a firm opinion as to whether the same bullet did or did not\r\npass through the President\u2019s neck first before inflicting all the\r\nwounds on Governor Connally.[C3-323] Based on the other circumstances,\r\nsuch as the relative positions of the President and the Governor in\r\nthe automobile, Dr. Light concluded that it was probable that the same\r\nbullet traversed the President\u2019s neck and inflicted all the wounds on\r\nGovernor Connally.[C3-324]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Subsequent Bullet That Hit\r\n\r\nAfter a bullet penetrated President Kennedy\u2019s neck, a subsequent shot\r\nentered the back of his head and exited through the upper right portion\r\nof his skull. The Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore films show the instant in\r\nthe sequence when that bullet struck. (See Commission Exhibit No. 902,\r\np. 108.) That impact was evident from the explosion of the President\u2019s\r\nbrain tissues from the right side of his head. The immediately\r\npreceding frame from the Zapruder film shows the President slumped to\r\nhis left, clutching at his throat, with his chin close to his chest and\r\nhis head tilted forward at an angle.[C3-325] Based upon information\r\nprovided by the doctors who conducted the autopsy, an artist\u2019s drawing\r\ndepicted the path of the bullet through the President\u2019s head, with his\r\nhead being in the same approximate position.[C3-326]\r\n\r\nBy using the Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore motion pictures, the\r\nPresident\u2019s location at the time the bullet penetrated his head was\r\nfixed with reasonable precision. A careful analysis of the Nix and\r\nMuchmore films led to fixing the exact location of these cameramen. The\r\npoint of impact of the bullet on the President\u2019s head was apparent in\r\nall of the movies. At that point in the Nix film a straight line was\r\nplotted from the camera position to a fixed point in the background\r\nand the President\u2019s location along this line was marked on a plat\r\nmap.[C3-327] A similar process was followed with the Muchmore film. The\r\nPresident\u2019s location on the plat map was identical to that determined\r\nfrom the Nix film.[C3-328] The President\u2019s location, established\r\nthrough the Nix and Muchmore films, was confirmed by comparing his\r\nposition on the Zapruder film.

This location had hitherto only been\r\napproximated, since there were no landmarks in the background of the\r\nZapruder frame for alinement purposes other than a portion of a painted\r\nline on the curb.[C3-329] Through these procedures, it was determined\r\nthat President Kennedy was shot in the head when he was 230.8 feet from\r\na point on the west curbline on Houston Street where it intersected\r\nwith Elm Street.[C3-330] The President was 265.3 feet from the rifle in\r\nthe sixth-floor window and at that position the approximate angle of\r\ndeclination was 15\u00b021\u2019.[C3-331]\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF SHOTS\r\n\r\nThe consensus among the witnesses at the scene was that three shots\r\nwere fired.[C3-332] However, some heard only two shots,[C3-333] while\r\nothers testified that they heard four and perhaps as many as five\r\nor six shots.[C3-334] The difficulty of accurate perception of the\r\nsound of gunshots required careful scrutiny of all of this testimony\r\nregarding the number of shots. The firing of a bullet causes a number\r\nof noises: the muzzle blast, caused by the smashing of the hot gases\r\nwhich propel the bullet into the relatively stable air at the gun\u2019s\r\nmuzzle; the noise of the bullet, caused by the shock wave built up\r\nahead of the bullet\u2019s nose as it travels through the air; and the noise\r\ncaused by the impact of the bullet on its target.[C3-335] Each noise\r\ncan be quite sharp and may be perceived as a separate shot. The tall\r\nbuildings in the area might have further distorted the sound.\r\n\r\nThe physical and other evidence examined by the Commission compels\r\nthe conclusion that at least two shots were fired. As discussed\r\npreviously, the nearly whole bullet discovered at Parkland Hospital\r\nand the two larger fragments found in the Presidential automobile,\r\nwhich were identified as coming from the assassination rifle, came from\r\nat least two separate bullets and possibly from three.[C3-336] The\r\nmost convincing evidence relating to the number of shots was provided\r\nby the presence on the sixth floor of three spent cartridges which\r\nwere demonstrated to have been fired by the same rifle that fired the\r\nbullets which caused the wounds. It is possible that the assassin\r\ncarried an empty shell in the rifle and fired only two shots, with the\r\nwitnesses hearing multiple noises made by the same shot. Soon after\r\nthe three empty cartridges were found, officials at the scene decided\r\nthat three shots were fired, and that conclusion was widely circulated\r\nby the press. The eyewitness testimony may be subconsciously colored\r\nby the extensive publicity given the conclusion that three shots were\r\nfired. Nevertheless, the preponderance of the evidence, in particular\r\nthe three spent cartridges, led the Commission to conclude that there\r\nwere three shots fired.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHOT THAT MISSED\r\n\r\nFrom the initial findings that (_a_) one shot passed through the\r\nPresident\u2019s neck and then most probably passed through the Governor\u2019s\r\nbody, (_b_) a subsequent shot penetrated the President\u2019s head, (_c_)\r\nno other shot struck any part of the automobile, and (_d_) three shots\r\nwere fired, it follows that one shot probably missed the car and its\r\noccupants. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether it was the first,\r\nsecond, or third shot which missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Shot\r\n\r\nIf the first shot missed, the assassin perhaps missed in an effort to\r\nfire a hurried shot before the President passed under the oak tree, or\r\npossibly he fired as the President passed under the tree and the tree\r\nobstructed his view. The bullet might have struck a portion of the tree\r\nand been completely deflected. On the other hand, the greatest cause\r\nfor doubt that the first shot missed is the improbability that the\r\nsame marksman who twice hit a moving target would be so inaccurate on\r\nthe first and closest of his shots as to miss completely, not only the\r\ntarget, but the large automobile.", "start_char_idx": 302818, "end_char_idx": 307293, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abe54675-fb01-4b83-86cf-cab70b9e6f6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "abe54675-fb01-4b83-86cf-cab70b9e6f6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "53126b0a-1d6d-4903-856d-d5e2ddb154ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "3a6c59cb9379b3114356b661684ed0594384becff19f15218818ea30cbc3386f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dde06bb4-dedd-4793-b07b-3f8ecb183ffd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0edb97cc8ec3e8abd916a46bb38f2799992d388116fd9609917165470b585317", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The evidence is inconclusive as to whether it was the first,\r\nsecond, or third shot which missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Shot\r\n\r\nIf the first shot missed, the assassin perhaps missed in an effort to\r\nfire a hurried shot before the President passed under the oak tree, or\r\npossibly he fired as the President passed under the tree and the tree\r\nobstructed his view.

Bennett, stationed in\r\nthe right rear seat of the President\u2019s followup car, who heard a sound\r\nlike a firecracker as the motorcade proceeded down Elm Street. At that\r\nmoment, Agent Bennett stated:\r\n\r\n    * * * I looked at the back of the President. I heard another\r\n    firecracker noise and saw that shot hit the President about\r\n    four inches down from the right shoulder. A second shot\r\n    followed immediately and hit the right rear high of the\r\n    President\u2019s head.[C3-337]\r\n\r\nSubstantial weight may be given Bennett\u2019s observations. Although his\r\nformal statement was dated November 23, 1963, his notes indicate that\r\nhe recorded what he saw and heard at 5:30 p.m., November 22, 1963, on\r\nthe airplane en route back to Washington, prior to the autopsy, when it\r\nwas not yet known that the President had been hit in the back.[C3-338]\r\nIt is possible, of course, that Bennett did not observe the hole in\r\nthe President\u2019s back, which might have been there immediately after the\r\nfirst noise.\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally\u2019s testimony supports the view that the first shot\r\nmissed, because he stated that he heard a shot, turned slightly to his\r\nright, and, as he started to turn back toward his left, was struck\r\nby the second bullet.[C3-339] He never saw the President during the\r\nshooting sequence, and it is entirely possible that he heard the missed\r\nshot and that both men were struck by the second bullet. Mrs. Connally\r\ntestified that after the first shot she turned and saw the President\u2019s\r\nhands moving toward his throat, as seen in the films at frame\r\n225.[C3-340] However, Mrs. Connally further stated that she thought her\r\nhusband was hit immediately thereafter by the second bullet.[C3-341]\r\nIf the same bullet struck both the President and the Governor, it is\r\nentirely possible that she saw the President\u2019s movements at the same\r\ntime as she heard the second shot. Her testimony, therefore, does not\r\npreclude the possibility of the first shot having missed.\r\n\r\nOther eyewitness testimony, however, supports the conclusion that the\r\nfirst of the shots fired hit the President. As discussed in chapter II,\r\nSpecial Agent Hill\u2019s testimony indicates that the President was hit by\r\nthe first shot and that the head injury was caused by a second shot\r\nwhich followed about 5 seconds later. James W. Altgens, a photographer\r\nin Dallas for the Associated Press, had stationed himself on Elm Street\r\nopposite the Depository to take pictures of the passing motorcade.\r\nAltgens took a widely circulated photograph which showed President\r\nKennedy reacting to the first of the two shots which hit him. (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 900, p. 113.)

There was,\r\nconceivably, a delayed reaction between the time the bullet struck him\r\nand the time he realized that he was hit, despite the fact that the\r\nbullet struck a glancing blow to a rib and penetrated his wrist bone.\r\nThe Governor did not even know that he had been struck in the wrist or\r\nin the thigh until he regained consciousness in the hospital the next\r\nday. Moreover, he testified that he did not hear what he thought was\r\nthe second shot, although he did hear a subsequent shot which coincided\r\nwith the shattering of the President\u2019s head.[C3-345] One possibility,\r\ntherefore, would be a sequence in which the Governor heard the first\r\nshot, did not immediately feel the penetration of the bullet, then\r\nfelt the delayed reaction of the impact on his back, later heard the\r\nshot which shattered the President\u2019s head, and then lost consciousness\r\nwithout hearing a third shot which might have occurred later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 900\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH BY AP PHOTOGRAPHER\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 901\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 255]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Shot\r\n\r\nThe possibility that the second shot missed is consistent with the\r\nelapsed time between the two shots that hit their mark. From the timing\r\nevidenced by the Zapruder films, there was an interval of from 4.8 to\r\n5.6 seconds between the shot which struck President Kennedy\u2019s neck\r\n(between frames 210 to 225) and the shot which struck his head at frame\r\n313.[C3-346] Since a minimum of 2.3 seconds must elapse between shots,\r\na bullet could have been fired from the rifle and missed during this\r\ninterval.[C3-347] This possibility was buttressed by the testimony of\r\nwitnesses who claimed that the shots were evenly spaced, since a second\r\nshot occurring within an interval of approximately 5 seconds would have\r\nto be almost exactly midway in this period. If Altgens\u2019 recollection\r\nis correct that he snapped his picture at the same moment as he heard\r\na shot, then it is possible that he heard a second shot which missed,\r\nsince a shot fired 2.3 seconds before he took his picture at frame 255\r\ncould have hit the President at about frame 213.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a substantial majority of the witnesses stated that\r\nthe shots were not evenly spaced. Most witnesses recalled that the\r\nsecond and third shots were bunched together, although some believed\r\nthat it was the first and second which were bunched.[C3-348] To the\r\nextent that reliance can be placed on recollection of witnesses as to\r\nthe spacing of the shots, the testimony that the shots were not evenly\r\nspaced would militate against a second shot missing. Another factor\r\narguing against the second shot missing is that the gunman would have\r\nbeen shooting at very near the minimum allowable time to have fired\r\nthe three shots within 4.8 to 5.6 seconds, although it was entirely\r\npossible for him to have done so.

This conclusion conforms most easily with the probability\r\nthat the assassin would most likely have missed the farthest shot,\r\nparticularly since there was an acceleration of the automobile after\r\nthe shot which struck the President\u2019s head. The limousine also changed\r\ndirection by following the curve to the right, whereas previously it\r\nhad been proceeding in almost a straight line with a rifle protruding\r\nfrom the sixth-floor window of the Depository Building.\r\n\r\nOne must consider, however, the testimony of the witnesses who\r\ndescribed the head shot as the concluding event in the assassination\r\nsequence. Illustrative is the testimony of Associated Press\r\nphotographer Altgens, who had an excellent vantage point near the\r\nPresident\u2019s car. He recalled that the shot which hit the President\u2019s\r\nhead \u201cwas the last shot--that much I will say with a great degree\r\nof certainty.\u201d[C3-349] On the other hand, Emmett J. Hudson, the\r\ngroundskeeper of Dealey Plaza, testified that from his position on\r\nElm Street, midway between Houston Street and the Triple Underpass,\r\nhe heard a third shot after the shot which hit the President in the\r\nhead.[C3-350] In addition, Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s testimony indicated that\r\nneither the first nor the second shot missed. Immediately after the\r\nfirst noise she turned, because of the Governor\u2019s yell, and saw her\r\nhusband raise his hand to his forehead. Then the second shot struck the\r\nPresident\u2019s head.[C3-351]\r\n\r\nSome evidence suggested that a third shot may have entirely missed and\r\nhit the turf or street by the Triple Underpass. Royce G. Skelton, who\r\nwatched the motorcade from the railroad bridge, testified that after\r\ntwo shots \u201cthe car came on down close to the Triple Underpass\u201d and an\r\nadditional shot \u201chit in the left front of the President\u2019s car on the\r\ncement.\u201d[C3-352] Skelton thought that there had been a total of four\r\nshots, either the third or fourth of which hit in the vicinity of the\r\nunderpass.[C3-353] Dallas Patrolman J.\u00a0W. Foster, who was also on the\r\nTriple Underpass, testified that a shot hit the turf near a manhole\r\ncover in the vicinity of the underpass.[C3-354] Examination of this\r\narea, however, disclosed no indication that a bullet struck at the\r\nlocations indicated by Skelton or Foster.[C3-355]\r\n\r\nAt a different location in Dealey Plaza, the evidence indicated that a\r\nbullet fragment did hit the street. James T. Tague, who got out of his\r\ncar to watch the motorcade from a position between Commerce and Main\r\nStreets near the Triple Underpass, was hit on the cheek by an object\r\nduring the shooting.[C3-356] Within a few minutes Tague reported this\r\nto Deputy Sheriff Eddy R. Walthers, who was examining the area to\r\nsee if any bullets had struck the turf.[C3-357] Walthers immediately\r\nstarted to search where Tague had been standing and located a place on\r\nthe south curb of Main Street where it appeared a bullet had hit the\r\ncement.[C3-358] According to Tague, \u201cThere was a mark quite obviously\r\nthat was a bullet, and it was very fresh.\u201d[C3-359] In Tague\u2019s opinion,\r\nit was the second shot which caused the mark, since he thinks he heard\r\nthe third shot after he was hit in the face.[C3-360] This incident\r\nappears to have been recorded in the contemporaneous report of Dallas\r\nPatrolman L.\u00a0L.

Nevertheless, the preponderance of the eyewitness\r\ntestimony that the head shot was the final shot must be weighed in any\r\ndetermination as to whether it was the third shot that missed. Even\r\nif it were caused by a bullet fragment, the mark on the south curb of\r\nMain Street cannot be identified conclusively with any of the three\r\nshots fired. Under the circumstances it might have come from the bullet\r\nwhich hit the President\u2019s head, or it might have been a product of the\r\nfragmentation of the missed shot upon hitting some other object in the\r\narea.[C3-364] Since he did not observe any of the shots striking the\r\nPresident, Tague\u2019s testimony that the second shot, rather than the\r\nthird, caused the scratch on his cheek, does not assist in limiting the\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of possibilities and the existence of conflicting\r\ntestimony, when coupled with the impossibility of scientific\r\nverification, precludes a conclusive finding by the Commission as to\r\nwhich shot missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME SPAN OF SHOTS\r\n\r\nWitnesses at the assassination scene said that the shots were\r\nfired within a few seconds, with the general estimate being 5 to 6\r\nseconds.[C3-365] That approximation was most probably based on the\r\nearlier publicized reports that the first shot struck the President in\r\nthe neck, the second wounded the Governor and the third shattered the\r\nPresident\u2019s head, with the time span from the neck to the head shots on\r\nthe President being approximately 5 seconds. As previously indicated,\r\nthe time span between the shot entering the back of the President\u2019s\r\nneck and the bullet which shattered his skull was 4.8 to 5.6 seconds.\r\nIf the second shot missed, then 4.8 to 5.6 seconds was the total time\r\nspan of the shots. If either the first or third shots missed, then a\r\nminimum of 2.3 seconds (necessary to operate the rifle) must be added\r\nto the time span of the shots which hit, giving a minimum time of 7.1\r\nto 7.9 seconds for the three shots.

Since the preponderance of the evidence\r\nindicated that three shots were fired, the Commission concluded that\r\none shot probably missed the Presidential limousine and its occupants,\r\nand that the three shots were fired in a time period ranging from\r\napproximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Assassin\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapter has established that the bullets which killed\r\nPresident Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired from the\r\nsoutheast corner window of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building and that the weapon which fired these bullets was\r\na Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle bearing the serial\r\nnumber C2766. In this chapter the Commission evaluates the evidence\r\nupon which it has based its conclusion concerning the identity of the\r\nassassin. This evidence includes (1) the ownership and possession of\r\nthe weapon used to commit the assassination, (2) the means by which the\r\nweapon was brought into the Depository Building, (3) the identity of\r\nthe person present at the window from which the shots were fired, (4)\r\nthe killing of Dallas Patrolman J.D. Tippit within 45 minutes after the\r\nassassination, (5) the resistance to arrest and the attempted shooting\r\nof another police officer by the man (Lee Harvey Oswald) subsequently\r\naccused of assassinating President Kennedy and killing Patrolman\r\nTippit, (6) the lies told to the police by Oswald, (7) the evidence\r\nlinking Oswald to the attempted killing of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n(Resigned, U.S. Army) on April 10, 1963, and (8) Oswald\u2019s capability\r\nwith a rifle.\r\n\r\n\r\nOWNERSHIP AND POSSESSION OF ASSASSINATION WEAPON\r\n\r\nPurchase of Rifle by Oswald\r\n\r\nShortly after the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was found on the sixth floor\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository Building,[C4-1] agents of the FBI\r\nlearned from retail outlets in Dallas that Crescent Firearms, Inc.,\r\nof New York City, was a distributor of surplus Italian 6.5-millimeter\r\nmilitary rifles.[C4-2] During the evening of November 22, 1963, a\r\nreview of the records of Crescent Firearms revealed that the firm had\r\nshipped an Italian carbine, serial number C2766, to Klein\u2019s Sporting\r\nGoods Co., of Chicago, Ill.[C4-3] After searching their records from\r\n10 p.m. to 4 a.m. the officers of Klein\u2019s discovered that a rifle\r\nbearing serial number C2766 had been shipped to one A. Hidell, Post\r\nOffice Box 2915, Dallas, Tex., on March 20, 1963.[C4-4] (See Waldman\r\nExhibit No. 7, p. 120.)\r\n\r\nAccording to its microfilm records, Klein\u2019s received an order for a\r\nrifle on March 13, 1963, on a coupon clipped from the February 1963\r\nissue of the American Rifleman magazine.

A bank deposit made on March 13, 1963,\r\nincluded an item of $21.45. Klein\u2019s shipping order form shows an\r\nimprint made by the cash register which recorded the receipt of $21.45\r\non March 13, 1963.

It bore\r\nthe manufacturer\u2019s serial number C2766. On that date, Klein\u2019s placed\r\nan internal control number VC836 on this rifle.[C4-11] According to\r\nKlein\u2019s shipping order form, one Italian carbine 6.5 X-4\u00d7 scope,\r\ncontrol number VC836, serial number C2766, was shipped parcel post to\r\n\u201cA.

(As discussed\r\nbelow in ch. VI, p. 292.)

J.\u00a0C. Day of\r\nthe identification bureau of the Dallas police. He lifted the rifle\r\nby the wooden stock after his examination convinced him that the wood\r\nwas too rough to take fingerprints. Capt. J.\u00a0W.

He applied fingerprint powder to the side\r\nof the metal housing near the trigger, and noticed traces of two\r\nprints.[C4-46] At 11:45 p.m. on November 22, the rifle was released\r\nto the FBI and forwarded to Washington where it was examined on the\r\nmorning of November 23 by Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the Latent\r\nFingerprint Section of the FBI\u2019s Identification Division.[C4-47]\r\n\r\nIn his testimony before the Commission, Latona stated that when he\r\nreceived the rifle, the area where prints were visible was protected by\r\ncellophane.[C4-48] He examined these prints, as well as photographs of\r\nthem which the Dallas police had made, and concluded that:\r\n\r\n    * * * the formations, the ridge formations and characteristics,\r\n    were insufficient for purposes of either effecting\r\n    identification or a determination that the print was not\r\n    identical with the prints of people. Accordingly, my opinion\r\n    simply was that the latent prints which were there were of no\r\n    value.[C4-49]\r\n\r\nLatona then processed the complete weapon but developed no identifiable\r\nprints.[C4-50] He stated that the poor quality of the wood and the\r\nmetal would cause the rifle to absorb moisture from the skin, thereby\r\nmaking a clear print unlikely.[C4-51]\r\n\r\nOn November 22, however, before surrendering possession of the rifle\r\nto the FBI Laboratory, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas Police Department\r\nhad \u201clifted\u201d a palmprint from the underside of the gun barrel \u201cnear\r\nthe firing end of the barrel about 3 inches under the Woodstock when I\r\ntook the Woodstock loose.\u201d[C4-52] \u201cLifting\u201d a print involves the use of\r\nadhesive material to remove the fingerprint powder which adheres to the\r\noriginal print. In this way the powdered impression is actually removed\r\nfrom the object.[C4-53] The lifting had been so complete in this case\r\nthat there was no trace of the print on the rifle itself when it was\r\nexamined by Latona. Nor was there any indication that the lift had been\r\nperformed.[C4-54] Day, on the other hand, believed that sufficient\r\ntraces of the print had been left on the rifle barrel, because he\r\ndid not release the lifted print until November 26, when he received\r\ninstructions to send \u201ceverything that we had\u201d to the FBI.[C4-55] The\r\nprint arrived in the FBI Laboratory in Washington on November 29,\r\nmounted on a card on which Lieutenant Day had written the words \u201coff\r\nunderside gun barrel near end of foregrip C2766.\u201d[C4-56] The print\u2019s\r\npositive identity as having been lifted from the rifle was confirmed\r\nby FBI Laboratory tests which established that the adhesive material\r\nbearing the print also bore impressions of the same irregularities that\r\nappeared on the barrel of the rifle.[C4-57]\r\n\r\nLatona testified that this palmprint was the right palmprint of\r\nLee Harvey Oswald.[C4-58] At the request of the Commission, Arthur\r\nMandella, fingerprint expert with the New York City Police Department,\r\nconducted an independent examination and also determined that this\r\nwas the right palmprint of Oswald.[C4-59] Latona\u2019s findings were also\r\nconfirmed by Ronald G.

Stombaugh, a special agent assigned to the Hair\r\nand Fiber Unit of the FBI Laboratory.[C4-65] He compared them with the\r\nfibers found in the shirt which Oswald was wearing when arrested in\r\nthe Texas Theatre.[C4-66] This shirt was also composed of dark blue,\r\ngray-black and orange-yellow cotton fibers. Stombaugh testified that\r\nthe colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the\r\nrifle matched those in Oswald\u2019s shirt.[C4-67] (See app. X, p. 592.)\r\n\r\nStombaugh explained in his testimony that in fiber analysis, as\r\ndistinct from fingerprint or firearms identification, it is not\r\npossible to state with scientific certainty that a particular small\r\ngroup of fibers come from a certain piece of clothing to the exclusion\r\nof all others because there are not enough microscopic characteristics\r\npresent in fibers.[C4-68] Judgments as to probability will depend on\r\nthe number and types of matches.[C4-69] He concluded, \u201cThere is no\r\ndoubt in my mind that these fibers could have come from this shirt.\r\nThere is no way, however, to eliminate the possibility of the fibers\r\nhaving come from another identical shirt.\u201d[C4-70]\r\n\r\nHaving considered the probabilities as explained in Stombaugh\u2019s\r\ntestimony, the Commission has concluded that the fibers in the tuft\r\non the rifle most probably came from the shirt worn by Oswald when he\r\nwas arrested, and that this was the same shirt which Oswald wore on\r\nthe morning of the assassination. Marina Oswald testified that she\r\nthought her husband wore this shirt to work on that day.[C4-71] The\r\ntestimony of those who saw him after the assassination was inconclusive\r\nabout the color of Oswald\u2019s shirt,[C4-72] but Mary Bledsoe, a former\r\nlandlady of Oswald, saw him on a bus approximately 10 minutes after\r\nthe assassination and identified the shirt as being the one worn by\r\nOswald primarily because of a distinctive hole in the shirt\u2019s right\r\nelbow.[C4-73] Moreover, the bus transfer which he obtained as he left\r\nthe bus was still in the pocket when he was arrested.[C4-74] Although\r\nOswald returned to his roominghouse after the assassination and when\r\nquestioned by the police, claimed to have changed his shirt,[C4-75] the\r\nevidence indicates that he continued wearing the same shirt which he\r\nwas wearing all morning and which he was still wearing when arrested.\r\n\r\nIn light of these findings the Commission evaluated the additional\r\ntestimony of Stombaugh that the fibers were caught in the crevice of\r\nthe rifle\u2019s butt plate \u201cin the recent past.\u201d[C4-76] Although Stombaugh\r\nwas unable to estimate the period of time the fibers were on the rifle\r\nhe said that the fibers \u201cwere clean, they had good color to them,\r\nthere was no grease on them and they were not fragmented.", "start_char_idx": 335950, "end_char_idx": 340027, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "359ef034-b802-4ccd-899c-ae9052da5e52": {"__data__": {"id_": "359ef034-b802-4ccd-899c-ae9052da5e52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d0993ac-eadd-438d-ab2e-45825d88e19a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "43899bd323b4fc4d8195085d71cd64ecda9504705b52a9ef3e75efd391568b53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2f5d90c-b8c5-4b88-917f-0c9acb02ee30", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0936f5158c45248545d20cc40cde95e91a0711cbab7bcbe73fa012b547a5e426", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C4-73] Moreover, the bus transfer which he obtained as he left\r\nthe bus was still in the pocket when he was arrested.[C4-74] Although\r\nOswald returned to his roominghouse after the assassination and when\r\nquestioned by the police, claimed to have changed his shirt,[C4-75] the\r\nevidence indicates that he continued wearing the same shirt which he\r\nwas wearing all morning and which he was still wearing when arrested.\r\n\r\nIn light of these findings the Commission evaluated the additional\r\ntestimony of Stombaugh that the fibers were caught in the crevice of\r\nthe rifle\u2019s butt plate \u201cin the recent past.\u201d[C4-76] Although Stombaugh\r\nwas unable to estimate the period of time the fibers were on the rifle\r\nhe said that the fibers \u201cwere clean, they had good color to them,\r\nthere was no grease on them and they were not fragmented. They looked\r\nas if they had just been picked up.\u201d[C4-77] The relative freshness\r\nof the fibers is strong evidence that they were caught on the rifle\r\non the morning of the assassination or during the preceding evening.\r\nFor 10 days prior to the eve of the assassination Oswald had not been\r\npresent at Ruth Paine\u2019s house in Irving, Tex.,[C4-78] where the rifle\r\nwas kept.[C4-79] Moreover, the Commission found no reliable evidence\r\nthat Oswald used the rifle at any time between September 23, when it\r\nwas transported from New Orleans, and November 22, the day of the\r\nassassination.[C4-80] The fact that on the morning of the assassination\r\nOswald was wearing the shirt from which these relatively fresh fibers\r\nmost probably originated, provides some evidence that they were placed\r\non the rifle that day since there was limited, if any, opportunity for\r\nOswald to handle the weapon during the 2 months prior to November 22.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Stombaugh pointed out that fibers might retain their\r\nfreshness if the rifle had been \u201cput aside\u201d after catching the fibers.\r\nThe rifle used in the assassination probably had been wrapped in a\r\nblanket for about 8 weeks prior to November 22.[C4-81] Because the\r\nrelative freshness of these fibers might be explained by the continuous\r\nstorage of the rifle in the blanket, the Commission was unable to reach\r\nany firm conclusion as to when the fibers were caught in the rifle. The\r\nCommission was able to conclude, however, that the fibers most probably\r\ncame from Oswald\u2019s shirt.

The Commission has concluded\r\nthat the rifle shown in these pictures is the same rifle which was\r\nfound on the sixth floor of the Depository Building on November 22,\r\n1963.

They are photographs of the\r\nsame scene.[C4-92] Since Exhibit No. 133-B was taken with Oswald\u2019s\r\ncamera, it is reasonably certain that Exhibit No. 133-A was taken by\r\nthe same camera at the same time, as Marina Oswald testified. Moreover,\r\nShaneyfelt testified that in his opinion the photographs were not\r\ncomposites of two different photographs and that Oswald\u2019s face had not\r\nbeen superimposed on another body.[C4-93]\r\n\r\nOne of the photographs taken by Marina Oswald was widely published\r\nin newspapers and magazines, and in many instances the details of\r\nthese pictures differed from the original, and even from each other,\r\nparticularly as to the configuration of the rifle. The Commission\r\nsought to determine whether these photographs were retouched prior\r\nto publication. Shaneyfelt testified that the published photographs\r\nappeared to be based on a copy of the original which the publications\r\nhad each retouched differently.[C4-94] Several of the publications\r\nfurnished the Commission with the prints they had used, or described by\r\ncorrespondence the retouching they had done. This information enabled\r\nthe Commission to conclude that the published pictures were the same\r\nas the original except for retouching done by these publications,\r\napparently for the purpose of clarifying the lines of the rifle and\r\nother details in the picture.[C4-95]\r\n\r\nThe dates surrounding the taking of this picture and the purchase of\r\nthe rifle reinforce the belief that the rifle in the photograph is\r\nthe rifle which Oswald bought from Klein\u2019s. The rifle was shipped\r\nfrom Klein\u2019s in Chicago on March 20, 1963, at a time when the Oswalds\r\nwere living on Neely Street.[C4-96] From an examination of one of\r\nthe photographs, the Commission determined the dates of the issues\r\nof the Militant and the Worker which Oswald was holding in his hand.\r\nBy checking the actual mailing dates of these issues and the time it\r\nusually takes to effect delivery to Dallas, it was established that the\r\nphotographs must have been taken sometime after March 27.[C4-97] Marina\r\nOswald testified that the photographs were taken on a Sunday about 2\r\nweeks before the attempted shooting of Maj.

Marina Oswald has stated that the rifle was\r\namong these possessions,[C4-105] although Ruth Paine testified that she\r\nwas not aware of it.[C4-106]\r\n\r\nFrom September 24, 1963, when Marina Oswald arrived in Irving from\r\nNew Orleans, until the morning of the assassination, the rifle was,\r\naccording to the evidence, stored in a green and brown blanket in the\r\nPaines\u2019 garage among the Oswalds\u2019 other possessions.[C4-107] About 1\r\nweek after the return from New Orleans, Marina Oswald was looking in\r\nthe garage for parts to the baby\u2019s crib and thought that the parts\r\nmight be in the blanket. When she started to open the blanket, she saw\r\nthe stock of the rifle.[C4-108] Ruth and Michael Paine both noticed the\r\nrolled-up blanket in the garage during the time that Marina Oswald was\r\nliving in their home.[C4-109] On several occasions, Michael Paine moved\r\nthe blanket in the garage.[C4-110] He thought it contained tent poles,\r\nor possibly other camping equipment such as a folding shovel.[C4-111]\r\nWhen he appeared before the Commission, Michael Paine lifted the\r\nblanket with the rifle wrapped inside and testified that it appeared\r\nto be the same approximate weight and shape as the package in his\r\ngarage.[C4-112]\r\n\r\nAbout 3 hours after the assassination, a detective and deputy sheriff\r\nsaw the blanket-roll, tied with a string, lying on the floor of the\r\nPaines\u2019 garage.

In this connection the\r\nCommission considered (1) the circumstances surrounding Oswald\u2019s return\r\nto Irving, Tex., on Thursday, November 21, 1963, (2) the disappearance\r\nof the rifle from its normal place of storage, (3) Oswald\u2019s arrival at\r\nthe Depository Building on November 22, carrying a long and bulky brown\r\npaper package, (4) the presence of a long handmade brown paper bag\r\nnear the point from which the shots were fired, and (5) the palmprint,\r\nfiber, and paper analyses linking Oswald and the assassination weapon\r\nto this bag.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Curtain Rod Story\r\n\r\nDuring October and November of 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald lived in a\r\nroominghouse in Dallas while his wife and children lived in Irving,\r\nat the home of Ruth Paine,[C4-115] approximately 15 miles from\r\nOswald\u2019s place of work at the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald\r\ntraveled between Dallas and Irving on weekends in a car driven by a\r\nneighbor of the Paines, Buell Wesley Frazier, who also worked at the\r\nDepository.[C4-116] Oswald generally would go to Irving on Friday\r\nafternoon and return to Dallas Monday morning. According to the\r\ntestimony of Frazier, Marina Oswald, and Ruth Paine, it appears that\r\nOswald never returned to Irving in midweek prior to November 21, 1963,\r\nexcept on Monday, October 21, when he visited his wife in the hospital\r\nafter the birth of their second child.[C4-117]\r\n\r\nDuring the morning of November 21, Oswald asked Frazier whether he\r\ncould ride home with him that afternoon. Frazier, surprised, asked\r\nhim why he was going to Irving on Thursday night rather than Friday.\r\nOswald replied, \u201cI\u2019m going home to get some curtain rods * * * [to]\r\nput in an apartment.\u201d[C4-118] The two men left work at 4:40 p.m. and\r\ndrove to Irving. There was little conversation between them on the way\r\nhome.[C4-119] Mrs. Linnie Mae Randle, Frazier\u2019s sister, commented to\r\nher brother about Oswald\u2019s unusual midweek return to Irving. Frazier\r\ntold her that Oswald had come home to get curtain rods.[C4-120]\r\n\r\nIt would appear, however, that obtaining curtain rods was not the\r\npurpose of Oswald\u2019s trip to Irving on November 21. Mrs. A.\u00a0C. Johnson,\r\nhis landlady, testified that Oswald\u2019s room at 1026 North Beckley Avenue\r\nhad curtains and curtain rods,[C4-121] and that Oswald had never\r\ndiscussed the subject with her.", "start_char_idx": 348832, "end_char_idx": 352842, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0544245-1d09-439e-9614-ccc81d5dd5ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0544245-1d09-439e-9614-ccc81d5dd5ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3a8d4f2-773e-4dd9-9f30-fdae0f75f187", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d4566efff1e32171df302e9f3dfb6551864566b516b70a80e3f8e97541fc5cd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "059cf034-0b02-4d0f-b031-287ae52db8cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6149a4c7995daf337343fc24914d34e18faaa7f8ba39ed8b29d78987eb97a8d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "and\r\ndrove to Irving.

Johnson,\r\nhis landlady, testified that Oswald\u2019s room at 1026 North Beckley Avenue\r\nhad curtains and curtain rods,[C4-121] and that Oswald had never\r\ndiscussed the subject with her.[C4-122] In the Paines\u2019 garage, along\r\nwith many other objects of a household character, there were two flat\r\nlightweight curtain rods belonging to Ruth Paine but they were still\r\nthere on Friday afternoon after Oswald\u2019s arrest.[C4-123] Oswald never\r\nasked Mrs. Paine about the use of curtain rods,[C4-124] and Marina\r\nOswald testified that Oswald did not say anything about curtain rods\r\non the day before the assassination.[C4-125] No curtain rods were\r\nknown to have been discovered in the Depository Building after the\r\nassassination.[C4-126] In deciding whether Oswald carried a rifle to\r\nwork in a long paper bag on November 22, the Commission gave weight to\r\nthe fact that Oswald gave a false reason for returning home on November\r\n21, and one which provided an excuse for the carrying of a bulky\r\npackage the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Missing Rifle\r\n\r\nBefore dinner on November 21, Oswald played on the lawn of the Paines\u2019\r\nhome with his daughter June.[C4-127] After dinner Ruth Paine and\r\nMarina Oswald were busy cleaning house and preparing their children\r\nfor bed.[C4-128] Between the hours of 8 and 9 p.m. they were occupied\r\nwith the children in the bedrooms located at the extreme east end of\r\nthe house.[C4-129] On the west end of the house is the attached garage,\r\nwhich can be reached from the kitchen or from the outside.[C4-130] In\r\nthe garage were the personal belongings of the Oswald family including,\r\nas the evidence has shown, the rifle wrapped in the old brown and green\r\nblanket.[C4-131]\r\n\r\nAt approximately 9 p.m., after the children had been put to bed, Mrs.\r\nPaine, according to her testimony before the Commission, \u201cwent out to\r\nthe garage to paint some children\u2019s blocks, and worked in the garage\r\nfor half an hour or so. I noticed when I went out that the light was\r\non.\u201d[C4-132] Mrs. Paine was certain that she had not left the light on\r\nin the garage after dinner.[C4-133] According to Mrs. Paine, Oswald\r\nhad gone to bed by 9 p.m.;[C4-134] Marina Oswald testified that it was\r\nbetween 9 and 10 p.m.[C4-135] Neither Marina Oswald nor Ruth Paine\r\nsaw Oswald in the garage.[C4-136] The period between 8 and 9 p.m.,\r\nhowever, provided ample opportunity for Oswald to prepare the rifle for\r\nhis departure the next morning. Only if disassembled could the rifle\r\nfit into the paper bag found near the window[C4-137] from which the\r\nshots were fired. A firearms expert with the FBI assembled the rifle\r\nin 6 minutes using a 10-cent coin as a tool, and he could disassemble\r\nit more rapidly.[C4-138] While the rifle may have already been\r\ndisassembled when Oswald arrived home on Thursday, he had ample time\r\nthat evening to disassemble the rifle and insert it into the paper bag.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the assassination, Marina Oswald was watching television\r\nwhen she learned of the shooting. A short time later Mrs. Paine told\r\nher that someone had shot the President \u201cfrom the building in which\r\nLee is working.\u201d Marina Oswald testified that at that time \u201cMy heart\r\ndropped. I then went to the garage to see whether the rifle was there\r\nand I saw that the blanket was still there and I said \u2018Thank God.\u2019\u201d She\r\ndid not unroll the blanket. She saw that it was in its usual position\r\nand it appeared to her to have something inside.[C4-139]\r\n\r\nSoon afterward, at about 3 p.m., police officers arrived and searched\r\nthe house.

Mrs. Randle stated that on\r\nthe morning of November 22, while her brother was eating breakfast, she\r\nlooked out the breakfast-room window and saw Oswald cross the street\r\nand walk toward the driveway where her brother parked his car near\r\nthe carport. He carried a \u201cheavy brown bag.\u201d[C4-147] Oswald gripped\r\nthe bag in his right hand near the top. \u201cIt tapered like this as he\r\nhugged it in his hand. It was * * * more bulky toward the bottom\u201d\r\nthan toward the top.[C4-148] She then opened the kitchen door and\r\nsaw Oswald open the right rear door of her brother\u2019s car and place\r\nthe package in the back of the car.[C4-149] Mrs. Randle estimated\r\nthat the package was approximately 28 inches long and about 8 inches\r\nwide.[C4-150] She thought that its color was similar to that of the\r\nbag found on the sixth floor of the School Book Depository after the\r\nassassination.[C4-151]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1304\r\n\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and paper bag found on the sixth floor\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository.]\r\n\r\nFrazier met Oswald at the kitchen door and together they walked to the\r\ncar.[C4-152] After entering the car, Frazier glanced over his shoulder\r\nand noticed a brown paper package on the back seat.", "start_char_idx": 355362, "end_char_idx": 359034, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c51c47b-fecc-4be4-ba96-8ed2130a58e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c51c47b-fecc-4be4-ba96-8ed2130a58e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "059cf034-0b02-4d0f-b031-287ae52db8cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "4d65d1ba635e945b63b7889f44b7afa04a7fc94714e87c8a781f4cfb29f15913", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ac3f146-a8f0-4d67-8fff-af044f3a1571", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5174de23402c74aa855501b7028470a8c3c37334a5a1cf328f9c145898d847de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C4-148] She then opened the kitchen door and\r\nsaw Oswald open the right rear door of her brother\u2019s car and place\r\nthe package in the back of the car.[C4-149] Mrs. Randle estimated\r\nthat the package was approximately 28 inches long and about 8 inches\r\nwide.[C4-150] She thought that its color was similar to that of the\r\nbag found on the sixth floor of the School Book Depository after the\r\nassassination.[C4-151]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1304\r\n\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and paper bag found on the sixth floor\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository.]\r\n\r\nFrazier met Oswald at the kitchen door and together they walked to the\r\ncar.[C4-152] After entering the car, Frazier glanced over his shoulder\r\nand noticed a brown paper package on the back seat.

Oswald left the car first, picked\r\nup the brown paper bag, and proceeded toward the building ahead of\r\nFrazier. Frazier walked behind and as they crossed the railroad tracks\r\nhe watched the switching of the cars. Frazier recalled that one end\r\nof the package was under Oswald\u2019s armpit and the lower part was held\r\nwith his right hand so that it was carried straight and parallel\r\nto his body. When Oswald entered the rear door of the Depository\r\nBuilding, he was about 50 feet ahead of Frazier. It was the first time\r\nthat Oswald had not walked with Frazier from the parking lot to the\r\nbuilding entrance.[C4-158] When Frazier entered the building, he did\r\nnot see Oswald.[C4-159] One employee, Jack Dougherty, believed that he\r\nsaw Oswald coming to work, but he does not remember that Oswald had\r\nanything in his hands as he entered the door.[C4-160] No other employee\r\nhas been found who saw Oswald enter that morning.[C4-161]\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether Oswald carried the assassination weapon in the\r\nbag which Frazier and Mrs. Randle saw, the Commission has carefully\r\nconsidered the testimony of these two witnesses with regard to the\r\nlength of the bag. Frazier and Mrs. Randle testified that the bag which\r\nOswald was carrying was approximately 27 or 28 inches long,[C4-162]\r\nwhereas the wooden stock of the rifle, which is its largest component,\r\nmeasured 34.8 inches.[C4-163] The bag found on the sixth floor was 38\r\ninches long.[C4-164] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, p. 132.)

The disassembled rifle was too long to be carried in this\r\nmanner.

Similarly, when the butt of the rifle was placed in Frazier\u2019s\r\nhand, it extended above his shoulder to ear level.[C4-166] Moreover,\r\nin an interview on December 1, 1963, with agents of the FBI, Frazier\r\nhad marked the point on the back seat of his car which he believed\r\nwas where the bag reached when it was laid on the seat with one edge\r\nagainst the door. The distance between the point on the seat and the\r\ndoor was 27 inches.[C4-167]\r\n\r\nMrs. Randle said, when shown the paper bag, that the bag she saw Oswald\r\ncarrying \u201cwasn\u2019t that long, I mean it was folded down at the top as\r\nI told you. It definitely wasn\u2019t that long.\u201d[C4-168] And she folded\r\nthe bag to a length of about 28\u00bd inches. Frazier doubted whether the\r\nbag that Oswald carried was as wide as the bag found on the sixth\r\nfloor,[C4-169] although Mrs. Randle testified that the width was\r\napproximately the same.[C4-170]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has weighed the visual recollection of Frazier and\r\nMrs. Randle against the evidence here presented that the bag Oswald\r\ncarried contained the assassination weapon and has concluded that\r\nFrazier and Randle are mistaken as to the length of the bag. Mrs.\r\nRandle saw the bag fleetingly and her first remembrance is that it was\r\nheld in Oswald\u2019s right hand \u201cand it almost touched the ground as he\r\ncarried it.\u201d[C4-171] Frazier\u2019s view of the bag was from the rear. He\r\ncontinually advised that he was not paying close attention.[C4-172] For\r\nexample, he said,\r\n\r\n    * * * I didn\u2019t pay too much attention the way he was walking\r\n    because I was walking along there looking at the railroad cars\r\n    and watching the men on the diesel switch them cars and I\r\n    didn\u2019t pay too much attention on how he carried the package at\r\n    all.[C4-173]\r\n\r\nFrazier could easily have been mistaken when he stated that Oswald held\r\nthe bottom of the bag cupped in his hand with the upper end tucked into\r\nhis armpit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation of Bag\r\n\r\nA handmade bag of wrapping paper and tape[C4-174] was found in the\r\nsoutheast corner of the sixth floor alongside the window from which the\r\nshots were fired.[C4-175] (See Commission Exhibit No. 2707, p. 142.) It\r\nwas not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a store and it\r\nwas presumably made for a particular purpose. It was the appropriate\r\nsize to contain, in disassembled form, Oswald\u2019s Mannlicher-Carcano\r\nrifle, serial No. C2766, which was also found on the sixth\r\nfloor.[C4-176] Three cartons had been placed at the window apparently\r\nto act as a gun rest and a fourth carton was placed behind those at the\r\nwindow.[C4-177] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1301, p. 138.) A person\r\nseated on the fourth carton could assemble the rifle without being seen\r\nfrom the rest of the sixth floor because the cartons stacked around the\r\nsoutheast corner would shield him.[C4-178] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n723, p. 80.)

Day.\u201d[C4-179]\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Evidence Linking Rifle and Oswald to Paper Bag\r\n\r\n_Oswald\u2019s fingerprint and palmprint found on bag._--Using a standard\r\nchemical method involving silver nitrates[C4-180] the FBI Laboratory\r\ndeveloped a latent palmprint and latent fingerprint on the bag.\r\n(See app. X, p. 565.) Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the FBI\u2019s\r\nLatent Fingerprint Section, identified these prints as the left index\r\nfingerprint and right palmprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-181] The\r\nportion of the palm which was identified was the heel of the right\r\npalm, i.e., the area near the wrist, on the little finger side.[C4-182]\r\nThese prints were examined independently by Ronald G. Wittmus of the\r\nFBI,[C4-183] and by Arthur Mandella, a fingerprint expert with the New\r\nYork City Police Department.[C4-184] Both concluded that the prints\r\nwere the right palm and left index finger of Lee Oswald. No other\r\nidentifiable prints were found on the bag.[C4-185]\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s palmprint on the bottom of the paper bag indicated, of course,\r\nthat he had handled the bag. Furthermore, it was consistent with the\r\nbag having contained a heavy or bulky object when he handled it since a\r\nlight object is usually held by the fingers.[C4-186] The palmprint was\r\nfound on the closed end of the bag. It was from Oswald\u2019s right hand, in\r\nwhich he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier\u2019s car to\r\nthe building.[C4-187]\r\n\r\n_Materials used to make bag._--On the day of the assassination, the\r\nDallas police obtained a sample of wrapping paper and tape from the\r\nshipping room of the Depository and forwarded it to the FBI Laboratory\r\nin Washington.[C4-188] James C. Cadigan, a questioned-documents expert\r\nwith the Bureau, compared the samples with the paper and tape in the\r\nactual bag. He testified, \u201cIn all of the observations and physical\r\ntests that I made I found * * * the bag * * * and the paper sample * *\r\n* were the same.\u201d[C4-189]\r\n\r\nAmong other tests, the paper and tape were submitted to fiber analysis\r\nand spectrographic examination.[C4-190] In addition the tape was\r\ncompared to determine whether the sample tape and the tape on the bag\r\nhad been taken from the tape dispensing machine at the Depository.\r\nWhen asked to explain the similarity of characteristics, Cadigan\r\nstated:[C4-191]\r\n\r\n    Well, briefly, it would be the thickness of both the paper and\r\n    the tape, the color under various lighting conditions of both\r\n    the paper and the tape, the width of the tape, the knurled\r\n    markings on the surface of the fiber, the texture of the fiber,\r\n    the felting pattern * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I found that the paper sack found on the sixth floor * * * and\r\n    the sample * * * had the same observable characteristics both\r\n    under the microscope and all the visual tests that I could\r\n    conduct.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The papers I also found were similar in fiber composition,\r\n    therefore, in addition to the visual characteristics,\r\n    microscopic and UV [ultra violet] characteristics.\r\n\r\nMr. Cadigan concluded that the paper and tape from the bag were\r\nidentical in all respects to the sample paper and tape taken from the\r\nTexas School Book Depository shipping room on November 22, 1963.", "start_char_idx": 364285, "end_char_idx": 368299, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ef7eab3-d9cb-4985-96cd-fd3e148447b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ef7eab3-d9cb-4985-96cd-fd3e148447b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "742500ad-e3a0-4a57-b587-98189c08fa93", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "b87993626a9624187a3a01967ee2515683b7043cb73cc6d392571c70292d25bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "34c4177a-54de-4b9c-a52b-c935398fd05d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d82a5cc7ea9b2a2b1c181e92ed5e2b8a5bbc586f0fb5679e04f161de05a23df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The papers I also found were similar in fiber composition,\r\n    therefore, in addition to the visual characteristics,\r\n    microscopic and UV [ultra violet] characteristics.\r\n\r\nMr. Cadigan concluded that the paper and tape from the bag were\r\nidentical in all respects to the sample paper and tape taken from the\r\nTexas School Book Depository shipping room on November 22, 1963.[C4-192]\r\n\r\nOn December 1, 1963, a replica bag was made from materials found on\r\nthat date in the shipping room. This was done as an investigatory aid\r\nsince the original bag had been discolored during various laboratory\r\nexaminations and could not be used for valid identification by\r\nwitnesses.[C4-193] Cadigan found that the paper used to make this\r\nreplica sack had different characteristics from the paper in the\r\noriginal bag.[C4-194] The science of paper analysis enabled him to\r\ndistinguish between different rolls of paper even though they were\r\nproduced by the same manufacturer.[C4-195]\r\n\r\nSince the Depository normally used approximately one roll of paper\r\nevery 3 working days,[C4-196] it was not surprising that the replica\r\nsack made on December 1, 1963, had different characteristics from\r\nboth the actual bag and the sample taken on November 22. On the other\r\nhand, since two rolls could be made from the same batch of paper, one\r\ncannot estimate when, prior to November 22, Oswald made the paper bag.\r\nHowever, the complete identity of characteristics between the paper\r\nand tape in the bag found on the sixth floor and the paper and tape\r\nfound in the shipping room of the Depository on November 22 enabled\r\nthe Commission to conclude that the bag was made from these materials.\r\nThe Depository shipping department was on the first floor to which\r\nOswald had access in the normal performance of his duties filling\r\norders.[C4-197]\r\n\r\n_Fibers in paper bag matched fibers in blanket._--When Paul M.\r\nStombaugh of the FBI Laboratory examined the paper bag, he found,\r\non the inside, a single brown delustered viscose fiber and several\r\nlight green cotton fibers.[C4-198] The blanket in which the rifle was\r\nstored was composed of brown and green cotton, viscose and woolen\r\nfibers.[C4-199]\r\n\r\nThe single brown viscose fiber found in the bag matched some\r\nof the brown viscose fibers from the blanket in all observable\r\ncharacteristics.[C4-200] The green cotton fibers found in the paper\r\nbag matched some of the green cotton fibers in the blanket \u201cin all\r\nobservable microscopic characteristics.\u201d[C4-201] Despite these matches,\r\nhowever, Stombaugh was unable to render an opinion that the fibers\r\nwhich he found in the bag had probably come from the blanket, because\r\nother types of fibers present in the blanket were not found in the bag.\r\nHe concluded:\r\n\r\n    All I would say here is that it is possible that these fibers\r\n    could have come from this blanket, because this blanket is\r\n    composed of brown and green woolen fibers, brown and green\r\n    delustered viscose fibers, and brown and green cotton fibers. *\r\n    * * We found no brown cotton fibers, no green viscose fibers,\r\n    and no woolen fibers.\r\n\r\n    So if I found all of these then I would have been able to say\r\n    these fibers probably had come from this blanket. But since I\r\n    found so few, then I would say the possibility exists, these\r\n    fibers could have come from this blanket.[C4-202]\r\n\r\nStombaugh confirmed that the rifle could have picked up fibers from the\r\nblanket and transferred them to the paper bag.[C4-203] In light of the\r\nother evidence linking Lee Harvey Oswald, the blanket, and the rifle\r\nto the paper bag found on the sixth floor, the Commission considered\r\nStombaugh\u2019s testimony of probative value in deciding whether Oswald\r\ncarried the rifle into the building in the paper bag.", "start_char_idx": 367881, "end_char_idx": 371697, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34c4177a-54de-4b9c-a52b-c935398fd05d": {"__data__": {"id_": "34c4177a-54de-4b9c-a52b-c935398fd05d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ef7eab3-d9cb-4985-96cd-fd3e148447b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "c3ec85c131d3a70abb7b5b499e1f577979dfbcda0fbc8943486c822cd6199442", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f95c426b-11e1-4294-b91d-de5188647915", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "20f45b54dd1417c7dc95fcdc7a7a80b8a8443d894513b7f7788c84e567fd0045", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "*\r\n    * * We found no brown cotton fibers, no green viscose fibers,\r\n    and no woolen fibers.\r\n\r\n    So if I found all of these then I would have been able to say\r\n    these fibers probably had come from this blanket.

Depository employees were laying\r\na new floor at the west end and transferring books from the west to\r\nthe east end of the building.[C4-218] The \u201cRolling Readers\u201d cartons,\r\nhowever, had not been moved by the floor layers and had apparently been\r\ntaken to the window from their regular position for some particular\r\npurpose.[C4-219] The \u201cRolling Readers\u201d boxes contained, instead of\r\nbooks, light blocks used as reading aids.[C4-220] They could be easily\r\nadjusted and were still solid enough to serve as a gun rest.\r\n\r\nThe box on the floor, behind the three near the window, had been\r\none of these moved by the floor layers from the west wall to near\r\nthe east side of the building in preparation for the laying of the\r\nfloor.[C4-221] During the afternoon of November 22, Lieutenant Day\r\nof the Dallas police dusted this carton with powder and developed\r\na palmprint on the top edge of the carton on the side nearest the\r\nwindow.[C4-222] The position of this palmprint on the carton was\r\nparallel with the long axis of the box, and at right angles with the\r\nshort axis; the bottom of the palm rested on the box.[C4-223] Someone\r\nsitting on the box facing the window would have his palm in this\r\nposition if he placed his hand alongside his right hip. (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1302, p. 139.) This print which had been cut out of the\r\nbox was also forwarded to the FBI and Latona identified it as Oswald\u2019s\r\nright palmprint.[C4-224] In Latona\u2019s opinion \u201cnot too long\u201d a time\r\nhad elapsed between the time that the print was placed on the carton\r\nand the time that it had been developed by the Dallas police.[C4-225]\r\nAlthough Bureau experiments had shown that 24 hours was a likely\r\nmaximum time, Latona stated that he could only testify with certainty\r\nthat the print was less than 3 days old.[C4-226]\r\n\r\nThe print, therefore, could have been placed on the carton at any time\r\nwithin this period. The freshness of this print could be estimated\r\nonly because the Dallas police developed it through the use of powder.\r\nSince cartons absorb perspiration, powder can successfully develop a\r\nprint on such material[C4-227] only within a limited time. When the FBI\r\nin Washington received the cartons, the remaining prints, including\r\nOswald\u2019s on the Rolling Readers carton, were developed by chemical\r\nprocesses. The freshness of prints developed in this manner[C4-228]\r\ncannot be estimated, so no conclusions can be drawn as to whether these\r\nremaining prints preceded or followed the print developed in Dallas\r\nby powder. Most of the prints were found to have been placed on the\r\ncartons by an FBI clerk and a Dallas police officer after the cartons\r\nhad been processed with powder by the Dallas Police.[C4-229] (See ch.\r\nVI, p. 249; app. X, p. 566.)\r\n\r\nIn his independent investigation, Arthur Mandella of the New York\r\nCity Police Department reached the same conclusion as Latona that the\r\nprints found on the cartons were those of Lee Harvey Oswald.", "start_char_idx": 374069, "end_char_idx": 378224, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "052621c4-f670-478d-9b26-c8f35f1ad938": {"__data__": {"id_": "052621c4-f670-478d-9b26-c8f35f1ad938", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f95c426b-11e1-4294-b91d-de5188647915", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "786a9bae0a17790a4fb65164507f06dcdc42c1cee88ba8e49b05b21d8701646b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6eabf57-7df8-4623-b184-67017d1a0ddc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "35f42559499725cdd899cd66218588b7cf58d961aabaca5a0fe918df0c1460fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "When the FBI\r\nin Washington received the cartons, the remaining prints, including\r\nOswald\u2019s on the Rolling Readers carton, were developed by chemical\r\nprocesses.

Wittmus, conducted a separate examination and\r\nalso agreed with Latona that the prints were Oswald\u2019s.[C4-231]\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the significance of these fingerprint and palmprint\r\nidentifications, the Commission considered the possibility that Oswald\r\nhandled these cartons as part of his normal duties. Since other\r\nidentifiable prints were developed on the cartons, the Commission\r\nrequested that they be compared with the prints of the 12 warehouse\r\nemployees who, like Oswald, might have handled the cartons. They were\r\nalso compared with the prints of those law enforcement officials who\r\nmight have handled the cartons. The results of this investigation are\r\nfully discussed in chapter VI, page 249. Although a person could handle\r\na carton and not leave identifiable prints, none of these employees\r\nexcept Oswald left identifiable prints on the cartons.[C4-232] This\r\nfinding, in addition to the freshness of one of the prints and the\r\npresence of Oswald\u2019s prints on two of the four cartons and the\r\npaper bag led the Commission to attach some probative value to the\r\nfingerprint and palmprint identifications in reaching the conclusion\r\nthat Oswald was at the window from which the shots were fired, although\r\nthe prints do not establish the exact time he was there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2707\r\n\r\nSIXTH FLOOR, TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY DALLAS, TEXAS]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s Presence on Sixth Floor Approximately 35 Minutes Before the\r\nAssassination\r\n\r\nAdditional testimony linking Oswald with the point from which the\r\nshots were fired was provided by the testimony of Charles Givens, who\r\nwas the last known employee to see Oswald inside the building prior\r\nto the assassination. During the morning of November 22, Givens was\r\nworking with the floor-laying crew in the southwest section of the\r\nsixth floor.[C4-233] At about 11:45 a.m. the floor-laying crew used\r\nboth elevators to come down from the sixth floor.

Brennan was an eyewitness to the shooting. As indicated\r\npreviously the Commission considered his testimony as probative in\r\nreaching the conclusion that the shots came from the sixth floor,\r\nsoutheast corner window of the Depository Building.[C4-247] (See ch.\r\nIII, pp. 61-68.) Brennan also testified that Lee Harvey Oswald, whom\r\nhe viewed in a police lineup on the night of the assassination, was\r\nthe man he saw fire the shots from the sixth-floor window of the\r\nDepository Building.[C4-248] When the shots were fired, Brennan was in\r\nan excellent position to observe anyone in the window. He was sitting\r\non a concrete wall on the southwest corner of Elm and Houston Streets,\r\nlooking north at the Depository Building which was directly in front of\r\nhim.[C4-249] The window was approximately 120 feet away.[C4-250](See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 477, p. 62.)\r\n\r\nIn the 6- to 8-minute period before the motorcade arrived,[C4-251]\r\nBrennan saw a man leave and return to the window \u201ca couple of\r\ntimes.\u201d[C4-252] After hearing the first shot, which he thought was a\r\nmotorcycle backfire, Brennan glanced up at the window. He testified\r\nthat \u201cthis man I saw previously was aiming for his last shot * * *\r\nas it appeared to me he was standing up and resting against the left\r\nwindow sill * * *.\u201d[C4-253]\r\n\r\nBrennan saw the man fire the last shot and disappear from the window.\r\nWithin minutes of the assassination, Brennan described the man to the\r\npolice.[C4-254] This description most probably led to the radio alert\r\nsent to police cars at approximately 12:45 p.m., which described the\r\nsuspect as white, slender, weighing about 165 pounds, about 5\u201910\u201d tall,\r\nand in his early thirties.[C4-255] In his sworn statement to the police\r\nlater that day, Brennan described the man in similar terms, except\r\nthat he gave the weight as between 165 and 175 pounds and the height\r\nwas omitted.[C4-256] In his testimony before the Commission, Brennan\r\ndescribed the person he saw as \u201c* * * a man in his early thirties,\r\nfair complexion, slender, but neat, neat slender, possible 5 foot 10 *\r\n* * 160 to 170 pounds.\u201d[C4-257] Oswald was 5\u20199\u201d, slender and 24 years\r\nold.

Tippit. The suspect was described as \u201ca\r\nwhite male about 30, 5\u20198\u201d, black hair, slender. * * *\u201d[C4-262] At 1:29\r\np.m. the police radio reported that the description of the suspect in\r\nthe Tippit shooting was similar to the description which had been given\r\nby Brennan in connection with the assassination.[C4-263] Approximately\r\n7 or 8 minutes later the police radio reported that \u201can eyeball\r\nwitness\u201d described the suspect in the Tippit shooting as \u201ca white male,\r\n27, 5\u201911\u201d, 165 pounds, black wavy hair.\u201d[C4-264] As will be discussed\r\nfully below, the Commission has concluded that this suspect was Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nAlthough Brennan testified that the man in the window was standing\r\nwhen he fired the shots,[C4-265] most probably he was either sitting\r\nor kneeling. The half-open window,[C4-266] the arrangement of the\r\nboxes,[C4-267] and the angle of the shots virtually preclude a standing\r\nposition.[C4-268] It is understandable, however, for Brennan to have\r\nbelieved that the man with the rifle was standing. A photograph\r\nof the building taken seconds after the assassination shows three\r\nemployees looking out of the fifth-floor window directly below the\r\nwindow from which the shots were fired. Brennan testified that\r\nthey were standing,[C4-269] which is their apparent position in the\r\nphotograph.[C4-270] (See Dillard Exhibits Nos. C and D. pp. 66-67.) But\r\nthe testimony of these employees,[C4-271] together with photographs\r\nsubsequently taken of them at the scene of the assassination,[C4-272]\r\nestablishes that they were either squatting or kneeling. (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 485, p. 69.)

According to Euins, however, as the man lowered\r\nhis head in order to aim the rifle down Elm Street, he appeared to have\r\na white bald spot on his head.[C4-307] Shortly after the assassination,\r\nEuins signed an affidavit describing the man as \u201cwhite,\u201d[C4-308] but\r\na radio reporter testified that Euins described the man to him as\r\n\u201ccolored.\u201d[C4-309] In his Commission testimony, Euins stated that\r\nhe could not ascertain the man\u2019s race and that the statement in the\r\naffidavit was intended to refer only to the white spot on the man\u2019s\r\nhead and not to his race.[C4-310] A Secret Service agent who spoke to\r\nEuins approximately 20 to 30 minutes after the assassination confirmed\r\nthat Euins could neither describe the man in the window nor indicate\r\nhis race.[C4-311] Accordingly, Euins\u2019 testimony is considered probative\r\nas to the source of the shots but is inconclusive as to the identity of\r\nthe man in the window.\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the evidence that Oswald was at the southeast corner\r\nwindow of the sixth floor at the time of the shooting, the Commission\r\nhas considered the allegation that Oswald was photographed standing in\r\nfront of the building when the shots were fired. The picture which gave\r\nrise to these allegations was taken by Associated Press Photographer\r\nJames W. Altgens, who was standing on the south side of Elm Street\r\nbetween the Triple Underpass and the Depository Building.[C4-312] As\r\nthe motorcade started its descent down Elm Street, Altgens snapped\r\na picture of the Presidential limousine with the entrance to the\r\nDepository Building in the background.[C4-313] Just before snapping\r\nthe picture Altgens heard a noise which sounded like the popping of\r\na firecracker. Investigation has established that Altgens\u2019 picture\r\nwas taken approximately 2 seconds after the firing of the shot which\r\nentered the back of the President\u2019s neck.[C4-314]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1061\r\n\r\nTEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY DIAGRAM OF FIRST FLOOR]\r\n\r\nIn the background of this picture were several employees watching\r\nthe parade from the steps of the Depository Building.

He was not certain, \u201cbut I am pretty sure they came\r\nfrom the building right on the northwest corner.\u201d[C4-324] He heard two\r\nmore shots spaced \u201cpretty well even to me.\u201d[C4-325] After the third\r\nshot, he \u201crevved that motorcycle up,\u201d drove to the northwest corner\r\nof Elm and Houston, and parked approximately 10 feet from the traffic\r\nsignal.[C4-326] As he was parking he noted that people were \u201cfalling,\r\nand they were rolling around down there * * * grabbing their children\u201d\r\nand rushing about.[C4-327] A woman screamed, \u201cOh, they have shot that\r\nman, they have shot that man.\u201d[C4-328] Baker \u201chad it in mind that the\r\nshots came from the top of this building here,\u201d so he ran straight to\r\nthe entrance of the Depository Building.[C4-329]\r\n\r\nBaker testified that he entered the lobby of the building and \u201cspoke\r\nout and asked where the stairs or elevator was * * * and this man,\r\nMr. Truly, spoke up and says, it seems to me like he says, \u2018I am a\r\nbuilding manager. Follow me, officer, and I will show you.\u2019\u201d[C4-330]\r\nBaker and building superintendent Roy Truly went through a second set\r\nof doors[C4-331] and stopped at a swinging door where Baker bumped into\r\nTruly\u2019s back.[C4-332] They went through the swinging door and continued\r\nat \u201ca good trot\u201d to the northwest corner of the floor where Truly hoped\r\nto find one of the two freight elevators. (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1061, p. 148.) Neither elevator was there.[C4-333] Truly pushed the\r\nbutton for the west elevator which operates automatically if the gate\r\nis closed.[C4-334] He shouted twice, \u201cTurn loose the elevator.\u201d[C4-335]\r\nWhen the elevator failed to come, Baker said, \u201clet\u2019s take the stairs,\u201d\r\nand he followed Truly up the stairway, which is to the west of the\r\nelevator.[C4-336]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1118\r\n\r\nTEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY DIAGRAM OF SECOND FLOOR SHOWING ROUTE OF\r\nOSWALD]\r\n\r\nThe stairway is located in the northwest corner of the Depository\r\nBuilding. The stairs from one floor to the next are \u201c=L=-shaped,\u201d\r\nwith both legs of the \u201c=L=\u201d approximately the same length. Because\r\nthe stairway itself is enclosed, neither Baker nor Truly could see\r\nanything on the second-floor hallway until they reached the landing at\r\nthe top of the stairs.[C4-337] On the second-floor landing there is a\r\nsmall open area with a door at the east end.

Baker\u2019s movements were timed with a stopwatch. On\r\nthe first test, the elapsed time between the simulated first shot and\r\nBaker\u2019s arrival on the second-floor stair landing was 1 minute and 30\r\nseconds. The second test run required 1 minute and 15 seconds.[C4-359]\r\n\r\nA test was also conducted to determine the time required to walk from\r\nthe southeast corner of the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom\r\nby stairway. Special Agent John Howlett of the Secret Service carried\r\na rifle from the southeast corner of the sixth floor along the east\r\naisle to the northeast corner. He placed the rifle on the floor near\r\nthe site where Oswald\u2019s rifle was actually found after the shooting.\r\nThen Howlett walked down the stairway to the second-floor landing and\r\nentered the lunchroom. The first test, run at normal walking pace,\r\nrequired 1 minute, 18 seconds;[C4-360] the second test, at a \u201cfast\r\nwalk\u201d took 1 minute, 14 seconds.[C4-361] The second test followed\r\nimmediately after the first. The only interval was the time necessary\r\nto ride in the elevator from the second to the sixth floor and walk\r\nback to the southeast corner. Howlett was not short winded at the end\r\nof either test run.[C4-362]\r\n\r\nThe minimum time required by Baker to park his motorcycle and reach\r\nthe second-floor lunchroom was within 3 seconds of the time needed to\r\nwalk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down the stairway to\r\nthe lunchroom. The time actually required for Baker and Truly to reach\r\nthe second floor on November 22 was probably longer than in the test\r\nruns. For example, Baker required 15 seconds after the simulated shot\r\nto ride his motorcycle 180 to 200 feet, park it, and run 45 feet to the\r\nbuilding.[C4-363] No allowance was made for the special conditions\r\nwhich existed on the day of the assassination--possible delayed\r\nreaction to the shot, jostling with the crowd of people on the steps\r\nand scanning the area along Elm Street and the parkway.[C4-364] Baker\r\nsaid, \u201cWe simulated the shots and by the time we got there, we did\r\neverything that I did that day, and this would be the minimum, because\r\nI am sure that I, you know, it took me a little longer.\u201d[C4-365] On\r\nthe basis of this time test, therefore, the Commission concluded that\r\nOswald could have fired the shots and still have been present in the\r\nsecond-floor lunchroom when seen by Baker and Truly.\r\n\r\nThat Oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the\r\nsecond-floor lunchroom is consistent with the movements of the two\r\nelevators, which would have provided the other possible means of\r\ndescent. When Truly, accompanied by Baker, ran to the rear of the\r\nfirst floor, he was certain that both elevators, which occupy the same\r\nshaft,[C4-366] were on the fifth floor.[C4-367] Baker, not realizing\r\nthat there were two elevators, thought that only one elevator was\r\nin the shaft and that it was two or three floors above the second\r\nfloor.[C4-368] In the few seconds which elapsed while Baker and Truly\r\nran from the first to the second floor, neither of these slow elevators\r\ncould have descended from the fifth to the second floor. Furthermore,\r\nno elevator was at the second floor when they arrived there.[C4-369]\r\nTruly and Baker continued up the stairs after the encounter with Oswald\r\nin the lunchroom.

Furthermore,\r\nno elevator was at the second floor when they arrived there.[C4-369]\r\nTruly and Baker continued up the stairs after the encounter with Oswald\r\nin the lunchroom. There was no elevator on the third or fourth floor.\r\nThe east elevator was on the fifth floor when they arrived; the west\r\nelevator was not. They took the east elevator to the seventh floor\r\nand ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several\r\nminutes.[C4-370]\r\n\r\nJack Dougherty, an employee working on the fifth floor, testified\r\nthat he took the west elevator to the first floor after hearing a\r\nnoise which sounded like a backfire.[C4-371] Eddie Piper, the janitor,\r\ntold Dougherty that the President had been shot,[C4-372] but in his\r\ntestimony Piper did not mention either seeing or talking with Dougherty\r\nduring these moments of excitement.[C4-373] Both Dougherty and Piper\r\nwere confused witnesses. They had no exact memory of the events of that\r\nafternoon. Truly was probably correct in stating that the west elevator\r\nwas on the fifth floor when he looked up the elevator shaft from the\r\nfirst floor. The west elevator was not on the fifth floor when Baker\r\nand Truly reached that floor, probably because Jack Dougherty took it\r\nto the first floor while Baker and Truly were running up the stairs or\r\nin the lunchroom with Oswald. Neither elevator could have been used by\r\nOswald as a means of descent.\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other\r\nemployees in the building. Three employees--James Jarman, Jr., Harold\r\nNorman, and Bonnie Ray Williams--were watching the parade from the\r\nfifth floor, directly below the window from which the shots were fired.\r\nThey rushed to the west windows after the shots were fired and remained\r\nthere until after they saw Patrolman Baker\u2019s white helmet on the fifth\r\nfloor moving toward the elevator.[C4-374] While they were at the west\r\nwindows their view of the stairwell was completely blocked by shelves\r\nand boxes.[C4-375] This is the period during which Oswald would have\r\ndescended the stairs. In all likelihood Dougherty took the elevator\r\ndown from the fifth floor after Jarman, Norman, and Williams ran to the\r\nwest windows and were deciding what to do. None of these three men saw\r\nDougherty, probably because of the anxiety of the moment and because\r\nof the books which may have blocked the view.[C4-376] Neither Jarman,\r\nNorman, Williams, or Dougherty saw Oswald.[C4-377]\r\n\r\nVictoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository\r\nBuilding, claimed that within about 1 minute following the shots she\r\nran from a window on the south side of the fourth floor,[C4-378]\r\ndown the rear stairs to the first floor, where she encountered two\r\nDepository employees--William Shelley and Billy Lovelady.[C4-379] If\r\nher estimate of time is correct, she reached the bottom of the stairs\r\nbefore Truly and Baker started up, and she must have run down the\r\nstairs ahead of Oswald and would probably have seen or heard him.\r\nActually she noticed no one on the back stairs. If she descended from\r\nthe fourth to the first floor as fast as she claimed in her testimony,\r\nshe would have seen Baker or Truly on the first floor or on the stairs,\r\nunless they were already in the second-floor lunchroom talking to\r\nOswald. When she reached the first floor, she actually saw Shelley and\r\nLovelady slightly east of the east elevator.\r\n\r\nShelley and Lovelady, however, have testified that they were watching\r\nthe parade from the top step of the building entrance when Gloria\r\nCalverly, who works in the Depository Building, ran up and said that\r\nthe President had been shot.[C4-380] Lovelady and Shelley moved\r\nout into the street.[C4-381] About this time Shelley saw Truly and\r\nPatrolman Baker go into the building.", "start_char_idx": 406421, "end_char_idx": 410737, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56f142f4-30e6-474d-8b38-e60a01f9958f": {"__data__": {"id_": "56f142f4-30e6-474d-8b38-e60a01f9958f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc4b80ea-db15-4a8b-a7ad-594e2f88b65e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "52b666a28801a0da1a866cb11dead4331f283f9e6373bcacb8366c809db149fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e09355f2-f00b-4952-8ebb-c6efcaf65d66", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4feabb243704839281f5da7c1559ecdceccbd49e50f8e950e1e190ab39248080", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Actually she noticed no one on the back stairs.

They reentered the building\r\nby the rear door several minutes after Baker and Truly rushed through\r\nthe front entrance.[C4-383] On entering, Lovelady saw a girl on the\r\nfirst floor who he believes was Victoria Adams.[C4-384] If Miss Adams\r\naccurately recalled meeting Shelley and Lovelady when she reached the\r\nbottom of the stairs, then her estimate of the time when she descended\r\nfrom the fourth floor is incorrect, and she actually came down the\r\nstairs several minutes after Oswald and after Truly and Baker as well.\r\n\r\n_Oswald\u2019s departure from building._--Within a minute after Baker\r\nand Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R.\u00a0A. Reid, clerical\r\nsupervisor for the Texas School Book Depository, saw him walk through\r\nthe clerical office on the second floor toward the door leading to the\r\nfront stairway. Mrs. Reid had watched the parade from the sidewalk in\r\nfront of the building with Truly and Mr. O.\u00a0V. Campbell, vice president\r\nof the Depository.[C4-385] She testified that she heard three shots\r\nwhich she thought came from the building.[C4-386] She ran inside and\r\nup the front stairs into the large open office reserved for clerical\r\nemployees. As she approached her desk, she saw Oswald.[C4-387] He\r\nwas walking into the office from the back hallway, carrying a full\r\nbottle of Coca-Cola in his hand,[C4-388] presumably purchased after\r\nthe encounter with Baker and Truly. As Oswald passed Mrs. Reid she\r\nsaid, \u201cOh, the President has been shot, but maybe they didn\u2019t hit\r\nhim.\u201d[C4-389] Oswald mumbled something and walked by.[C4-390] She\r\npaid no more attention to him. The only exit from the office in\r\nthe direction Oswald was moving was through the door to the front\r\nstairway.[C4-391] (See Commission Exhibit 1118, p. 150.) Mrs. Reid\r\ntestified that when she saw Oswald, he was wearing a T-shirt and no\r\njacket.[C4-392] When he left home that morning, Marina Oswald, who\r\nwas still in bed, suggested that he wear a jacket.[C4-393] A blue\r\njacket, later identified by Marina Oswald as her husband\u2019s,[C4-394] was\r\nsubsequently found in the building,[C4-395] apparently left behind by\r\nOswald.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reid believes that she returned to her desk from the street about\r\n2 minutes after the shooting.[C4-396] Reconstructing her movements,\r\nMrs. Reid ran the distance three times and was timed in 2 minutes by\r\nstopwatch.[C4-397] The reconstruction was the minimum time.[C4-398]\r\nAccordingly, she probably met Oswald at about 12:32, approximately\r\n30-45 seconds after Oswald\u2019s lunchroom encounter with Baker and Truly.\r\nAfter leaving Mrs. Reid in the front office, Oswald could have gone\r\ndown the stairs and out the front door by 12:33 p.m.[C4-399]--3 minutes\r\nafter the shooting. At that time the building had not yet been sealed\r\noff by the police.\r\n\r\nWhile it was difficult to determine exactly when the police sealed off\r\nthe building, the earliest estimates would still have permitted Oswald\r\nto leave the building by 12:33.

One of the police officers assigned to\r\nthe corner of Elm and Houston Streets for the Presidential motorcade,\r\nW.E. Barnett, testified that immediately after the shots he went to\r\nthe rear of the building to check the fire escape. He then returned to\r\nthe corner of Elm and Houston where he met a sergeant who instructed\r\nhim to find out the name of the building. Barnett ran to the building,\r\nnoted its name, and then returned to the corner.[C4-400] There he was\r\nmet by a construction worker--in all likelihood Howard Brennan, who\r\nwas wearing his work helmet.[C4-401] This worker told Barnett that\r\nthe shots had been fired from a window in the Depository Building,\r\nwhereupon Barnett posted himself at the front door to make certain that\r\nno one left the building. The sergeant did the same thing at the rear\r\nof the building.[C4-402] Barnett estimated that approximately 3 minutes\r\nelapsed between the time he heard the last of the shots and the time\r\nhe started guarding the front door.

Sorrels of the Secret Service, who had been\r\nin the motorcade, testified that after driving to Parkland Hospital,\r\nhe returned to the Depository Building about 20 minutes after the\r\nshooting, found no police officers at the rear door and was able to\r\nenter through this door without identifying himself.[C4-412]\r\n\r\nAlthough Oswald probably left the building at about 12:33 p.m., his\r\nabsence was not noticed until at least one-half hour later. Truly,\r\nwho had returned with Patrolman Baker from the roof, saw the police\r\nquestioning the warehouse employees.

Fritz believed that he learned of Oswald\u2019s absence after\r\nthe rifle was found.[C4-417] The fact that Truly found Fritz in the\r\nnorthwest corner of the floor, near the point where the rifle was\r\nfound, supports Fritz\u2019 recollection.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nFingerprint and palmprint evidence establishes that Oswald handled\r\ntwo of the four cartons next to the window and also handled a paper\r\nbag which was found near the cartons. Oswald was seen in the vicinity\r\nof the southeast corner of the sixth floor approximately 35 minutes\r\nbefore the assassination and no one could be found who saw Oswald\r\nanywhere else in the building until after the shooting. An eyewitness\r\nto the shooting immediately provided a description of the man in the\r\nwindow which was similar to Oswald\u2019s actual appearance. This witness\r\nidentified Oswald in a lineup as the man most nearly resembling the man\r\nhe saw and later identified Oswald as the man he observed. Oswald\u2019s\r\nknown actions in the building immediately after the assassination are\r\nconsistent with his having been at the southeast corner window of the\r\nsixth floor at 12:30 p.m. On the basis of these findings the Commission\r\nhas concluded that Oswald, at the time of the assassination, was\r\npresent at the window from which the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KILLING OF PATROLMAN J.\u00a0D. TIPPIT\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Depository Building at approximately 12:33 p.m.,\r\nLee Harvey Oswald proceeded to his roominghouse by bus and taxi. He\r\narrived at approximately 1 p.m. and left a few minutes later. At about\r\n1:16 p.m., a Dallas police officer, J.\u00a0D. Tippit, was shot less than\r\n1 mile from Oswald\u2019s roominghouse. In deciding whether Oswald killed\r\nPatrolman Tippit the Commission considered the following: (1) positive\r\nidentification of the killer by two eyewitnesses who saw the shooting\r\nand seven eyewitnesses who heard the shots and saw the gunman flee\r\nthe scene with the revolver in his hand, (2) testimony of firearms\r\nidentification experts establishing the identity of the murder weapon,\r\n(3) evidence establishing the ownership of the murder weapon, (4)\r\nevidence establishing the ownership of a zipper jacket found along the\r\npath of flight taken by the gunman from the scene of the shooting to\r\nthe place of arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s Movements After Leaving Depository Building\r\n\r\n_The bus ride._--According to the reconstruction of time and events\r\nwhich the Commission found most credible, Lee Harvey Oswald left the\r\nbuilding approximately 3 minutes after the assassination. He probably\r\nwalked east on Elm Street for seven blocks to the corner of Elm and\r\nMurphy where he boarded a bus which was heading back in the direction\r\nof the Depository Building, on its way to the Oak Cliff section of\r\nDallas.

Nov. 22, \u201963\u201d and was punched in two places by\r\nthe busdriver. On the basis of this punchmark, which was distinctive\r\nto each Dallas driver, the transfer was conclusively identified as\r\nhaving been issued by Cecil J. McWatters, a busdriver for the Dallas\r\nTransit Co.[C4-419] On the basis of the date and time on the transfer,\r\nMcWatters was able to testify that the transfer had been issued by him\r\non a trip which passed a check point at St. Paul and Elm Streets at\r\n12:36 p.m., November 22, 1963.", "start_char_idx": 416437, "end_char_idx": 420607, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05259690-85bc-46de-9a1c-30147e240e80": {"__data__": {"id_": "05259690-85bc-46de-9a1c-30147e240e80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "abe9f565-f8a3-43b4-b5eb-de33bb52dbf4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "5e7732521e514b0754dda7fd5901e2b147cb1476dd09a49d8e30ed4e33ddc1f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2839eed6-8df0-44bd-b899-3cea4f090aa1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e3360044e7a72b52f1b248fc61f46ba0f7eae30f00464032aea4b7e4accb8e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(See Commission Exhibit 1119-A, p. 158.)\r\n\r\nWhen Oswald was apprehended, a bus transfer marked for the\r\nLakewood-Marsalis route was found in his shirt pocket.[C4-418] The\r\ntransfer was dated \u201cFri.

McWatters, a busdriver for the Dallas\r\nTransit Co.[C4-419] On the basis of the date and time on the transfer,\r\nMcWatters was able to testify that the transfer had been issued by him\r\non a trip which passed a check point at St. Paul and Elm Streets at\r\n12:36 p.m., November 22, 1963.[C4-420]\r\n\r\nMcWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time and he\r\nestimated that it took him 3 to 4 minutes to drive three blocks west\r\nfrom the checkpoint to Field Street, which he reached at about 12:40\r\np.m.[C4-421] McWatters\u2019 recollection is that he issued this transfer to\r\na man who entered his bus just beyond Field Street, where a man beat on\r\nthe front door of the bus, boarded it and paid his fare.[C4-422] About\r\ntwo blocks later, a woman asked to get off to make a 1 o\u2019clock train at\r\nUnion Station and requested a transfer which she might use if she got\r\nthrough the traffic.\r\n\r\n    * * * So I gave her a transfer and opened the door and she was\r\n    going out the gentleman I had picked up about two blocks [back]\r\n    asked for a transfer and got off at the same place in the\r\n    middle of the block where the lady did.\r\n\r\n    * * * It was the intersection near Lamar Street, it was near\r\n    Poydras and Lamar Street.[C4-423]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1119-A\r\n\r\n  WHEREABOUTS OF\r\n  LEE HARVEY OSWALD\r\n  between\r\n  12:33 P.M. and 1:50 P.M.\r\n  November 22, 1963\r\n\r\n  (ALL TIMES ARE APPROXIMATE)\r\n] The man was on the bus approximately 4 minutes.[C4-424]\r\n\r\nAt about 6:30 p.m. on the day of the assassination, McWatters viewed\r\nfour men in a police lineup. He picked Oswald from the lineup as the\r\nman who had boarded the bus at the \u201clower end of town on Elm around\r\nHouston,\u201d and who, during the ride south on Marsalis, had an argument\r\nwith a woman passenger.[C4-425] In his Commission testimony, McWatters\r\nsaid he had been in error and that a teenager named Milton Jones was\r\nthe passenger he had in mind.[C4-426] In a later interview, Jones\r\nconfirmed that he had exchanged words with a woman passenger on the bus\r\nduring the ride south on Marsalis.[C4-427] McWatters also remembered\r\nthat a man received a transfer at Lamar and Elm Streets and that a\r\nman in the lineup was about the size of this man.[C4-428] However,\r\nMcWatters\u2019 recollection alone was too vague to be a basis for placing\r\nOswald on the bus.\r\n\r\nRiding on the bus was an elderly woman, Mary Bledsoe, who confirmed\r\nthe mute evidence of the transfer. Oswald had rented a room from Mrs.\r\nBledsoe about 6 weeks before, on October 7,[C4-429] but she had asked\r\nhim to leave at the end of a week. Mrs. Bledsoe told him \u201cI am not\r\ngoing to rent to you any more.\u201d[C4-430] She testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t like\r\nhis attitude. * * * There was just something about him I didn\u2019t like or\r\nwant him. * * * Just didn\u2019t want him around me.\u201d [C4-431] On November\r\n22, Mrs. Bledsoe came downtown to watch the Presidential motorcade.\r\nShe boarded the Marsalis bus at St. Paul and Elm Streets to return\r\nhome.[C4-432] She testified further:\r\n\r\n    And, after we got past Akard, at Murphy--I figured it out.\r\n    Let\u2019s see.

As the bus neared Lamar Street, Oswald left the bus and\r\ndisappeared into the crowd.[C4-439]\r\n\r\nThe Marsalis bus which Oswald boarded traveled a route west on Elm,\r\nsouth on Houston, and southwest across the Houston viaduct to service\r\nthe Oak Cliff area along Marsalis.[C4-440] A Beckley bus which also\r\nserved the Oak Cliff area, followed the same route as the Marsalis\r\nbus through downtown Dallas, except that it continued west on Elm,\r\nacross Houston in front of the Depository Building, past the Triple\r\nUnderpass into west Dallas, and south on Beckley.[C4-441] Marsalis\r\nStreet is seven blocks from Beckley.[C4-442] Oswald lived at 1026 North\r\nBeckley.[C4-443] He could not reach his roominghouse on the Marsalis\r\nbus, but the Beckley bus stopped across the street.[C4-444] According\r\nto McWatters, the Beckley bus was behind the Marsalis bus, but he did\r\nnot actually see it.[C4-445] Both buses stopped within one block of the\r\nDepository Building. Instead of waiting there, Oswald apparently went\r\nas far away as he could and boarded the first Oak Cliff bus which came\r\nalong rather than wait for one which stopped across the street from his\r\nroominghouse.\r\n\r\nIn a reconstruction of this bus trip, agents of the Secret Service\r\nand the FBI walked the seven blocks from the front entrance of the\r\nDepository Building to Murphy and Elm three times, averaging 6\u00bd minutes\r\nfor the three trips.[C4-446] A bus moving through heavy traffic on\r\nElm from Murphy to Lamar was timed at 4 minutes.[C4-447] If Oswald\r\nleft the Depository Building at 12:33 p.m., walked seven blocks\r\ndirectly to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately, he\r\nwould have boarded the bus at approximately 12:40 p.m. and left it at\r\napproximately 12:44 p.m. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.)", "start_char_idx": 422910, "end_char_idx": 426338, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ee966dc-ed95-46f1-a5bc-ff2ff179891f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ee966dc-ed95-46f1-a5bc-ff2ff179891f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2839eed6-8df0-44bd-b899-3cea4f090aa1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "4923cb33dd549f22464c4f54e5f58edf764adc9f0bf0cb4e8894767ceadb3b5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1606073e-5e01-472e-90ec-e0a981e43359", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "707db988d8466f763e25ae74c1739543db4f924e47c4f0a73f90837581dd7870", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In a reconstruction of this bus trip, agents of the Secret Service\r\nand the FBI walked the seven blocks from the front entrance of the\r\nDepository Building to Murphy and Elm three times, averaging 6\u00bd minutes\r\nfor the three trips.[C4-446] A bus moving through heavy traffic on\r\nElm from Murphy to Lamar was timed at 4 minutes.[C4-447] If Oswald\r\nleft the Depository Building at 12:33 p.m., walked seven blocks\r\ndirectly to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately, he\r\nwould have boarded the bus at approximately 12:40 p.m. and left it at\r\napproximately 12:44 p.m. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.)\r\n\r\nRoger D. Craig, a deputy sheriff of Dallas County, claimed that\r\nabout 15 minutes after the assassination he saw a man, whom he later\r\nidentified as Oswald,[C4-448] coming from the direction of the\r\nDepository Building and running down the hill north of Elm Street\r\ntoward a light-colored Rambler station wagon, which was moving slowly\r\nalong Elm toward the underpass.[C4-449] The station wagon stopped to\r\npick up the man and then drove off.[C4-450] Craig testified that later\r\nin the afternoon he saw Oswald in the police interrogation room and\r\ntold Captain Fritz that Oswald was the man he saw.[C4-451] Craig also\r\nclaimed that when Fritz pointed out to Oswald that Craig had identified\r\nhim, Oswald rose from his chair, looked directly at Fritz, and said,\r\n\u201cEverybody will know who I am now.\u201d[C4-452]\r\n\r\nThe Commission could not accept important elements of Craig\u2019s\r\ntestimony. Captain Fritz stated that a deputy sheriff whom he could\r\nnot identify did ask to see him that afternoon and told him a similar\r\nstory to Craig\u2019s.[C4-453] Fritz did not bring him into his office\r\nto identify Oswald but turned him over to Lieutenant Baker for\r\nquestioning. If Craig saw Oswald that afternoon, he saw him through the\r\nglass windows of the office. And neither Captain Fritz nor any other\r\nofficer can remember that Oswald dramatically arose from his chair\r\nand said, \u201cEverybody will know who I am now.\u201d[C4-454] If Oswald had\r\nmade such a statement, Captain Fritz and others present would probably\r\nhave remembered it. Craig may have seen a person enter a white Rambler\r\nstation wagon 15 or 20 minutes after the shooting and travel west on\r\nElm Street, but the Commission concluded that this man was not Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald, because of the overwhelming evidence that Oswald was far\r\naway from the building by that time.\r\n\r\n_The taxicab ride._--William Whaley, a taxicab driver, told his\r\nemployer on Saturday morning, November 23, that he recognized Oswald\r\nfrom a newspaper photograph as a man whom he had driven to the Oak\r\nCliff area the day before.[C4-455] Notified of Whaley\u2019s statement, the\r\npolice brought him to the police station that afternoon. He was taken\r\nto the lineup room where, according to Whaley, five young teenagers,\r\nall handcuffed together, were displayed with Oswald.[C4-456] He\r\ntestified that Oswald looked older than the other boys.[C4-457] The\r\npolice asked him whether he could pick out his passenger from the\r\nlineup. Whaley picked Oswald. He said,\r\n\r\n    * * * you could have picked him out without identifying him by\r\n    just listening to him because he was bawling out the policeman,\r\n    telling them it wasn\u2019t right to put him in line with these\r\n    teenagers and all of that and they asked me which one and I\r\n    told them. It was him all right, the same man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He showed no respect for the policemen, he told them what he\r\n    thought about them. They knew what they were doing and they\r\n    were trying to railroad him and he wanted his lawyer.[C4-458]\r\n\r\nWhaley believes that Oswald\u2019s conduct did not aid him in his\r\nidentification \u201cbecause I knew he was the right one as soon as I saw\r\nhim.\u201d[C4-459]\r\n\r\nWhaley\u2019s memory of the lineup is inaccurate.

Only two of the men in the lineup with Oswald were teenagers:\r\nJohn T. Horn, aged 18, was No. 1; David Knapp, aged 18, was No. 2; Lee\r\nOswald was No. 3; and Daniel Lujan, aged 26, was No. 4.[C4-462]\r\n\r\nWhen he first testified before the Commission, Whaley displayed a trip\r\nmanifest[C4-463] which showed a 12 o\u2019clock trip from Travis Hotel to\r\nthe Continental bus station, unloaded at 12:15 p.m., a 12:15 p.m.\r\npickup at Continental to Greyhound, unloaded at 12:30 p.m., and a\r\npickup from Greyhound (bus station) at 12:30 p.m., unloaded at 500\r\nNorth Beckley at 12:45 p.m. Whaley testified that he did not keep an\r\naccurate time record of his trips but recorded them by the quarter\r\nhour, and that sometimes he made his entry right after a trip while\r\nat other times he waited to record three or four trips.[C4-464] As he\r\nunloaded his Continental bus station passenger in front of Greyhound,\r\nhe started to get out to buy a package of cigarettes.[C4-465] He saw a\r\nman walking south on Lamar from Commerce. The man was dressed in faded\r\nblue color khaki work clothes, a brown shirt, and some kind of work\r\njacket that almost matched his pants.[C4-466] The man asked, \u201cMay I\r\nhave the cab?\u201d, and got into the front seat.[C4-467] Whaley described\r\nthe ensuing events as follows:\r\n\r\n    And about that time an old lady, I think she was an old lady,\r\n    I don\u2019t remember nothing but her sticking her head down past\r\n    him in the door and said, \u201cDriver, will you call me a cab down\r\n    here?\u201d\r\n\r\n    She had seen him get this cab and she wanted one, too, and he\r\n    opened the door a little bit like he was going to get out and\r\n    he said, \u201cI will let you have this one,\u201d and she says, \u201cNo, the\r\n    driver can call me one.\u201d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    * * * I asked him where he wanted to go. And he said, \u201c500\r\n    North Beckley.\u201d\r\n\r\n    Well, I started up, I started to that address, and the police\r\n    cars, the sirens was going, running crisscrossing everywhere,\r\n    just a big uproar in that end of town and I said, \u201cWhat the\r\n    hell. I wonder what the hell is the uproar?\u201d\r\n\r\n    And he never said anything. So I figured he was one of these\r\n    people that don\u2019t like to talk so I never said any more to him.\r\n\r\n    But when I got pretty close to 500 block at Neches and North\r\n    Beckley which is the 500 block, he said, \u201cThis will do fine,\u201d\r\n    and I pulled over to the curb right there.

Neches is within one-half\r\nblock of the roominghouse at 1026 North Beckley where Oswald was\r\nliving. The 500 block of North Beckley is five blocks south of the\r\nroominghouse.[C4-471]\r\n\r\nAfter a review of these inconsistencies in his testimony before the\r\nCommission, Whaley was interviewed again in Dallas. The route of the\r\ntaxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.[C4-472] He directed\r\nthe driver of the car to a point 20 feet north of the northwest\r\ncorner of the intersection of Beckley and Neely, the point at which\r\nhe said his passenger alighted.[C4-473] This was the 700 block of\r\nNorth Beckley.[C4-474] The elapsed time of the reconstructed run from\r\nthe Greyhound Bus Station to Neely and Beckley was 5 minutes and 30\r\nseconds by stopwatch.[C4-475] The walk from Beckley and Neely to 1026\r\nNorth Beckley was timed by Commission counsel at 5 minutes and 45\r\nseconds.[C4-476]\r\n\r\nWhaley testified that Oswald was wearing either the gray zippered\r\njacket or the heavy blue jacket.[C4-477] He was in error, however.\r\nOswald could not possibly have been wearing the blue jacket during\r\nthe trip with Whaley, since it was found in the \u201cdomino\u201d room of\r\nthe Depository late in November.[C4-478] Moreover, Mrs. Bledsoe saw\r\nOswald in the bus without a jacket and wearing a shirt with a hole at\r\nthe elbow.[C4-479] On the other hand, Whaley identified Commission\r\nExhibit No. 150 (the shirt taken from Oswald upon arrest) as the shirt\r\nhis passenger was wearing.[C4-480] He also stated he saw a silver\r\nidentification bracelet on his passenger\u2019s left wrist.[C4-481] Oswald\r\nwas wearing such a bracelet when he was arrested.[C4-482]\r\n\r\nOn November 22, Oswald told Captain Fritz that he rode a bus to a stop\r\nnear his home and then walked to his roominghouse.[C4-483] When queried\r\nthe following morning concerning a bus transfer found in his possession\r\nat the time of his arrest, he admitted receiving it.[C4-484] And when\r\ninterrogated about a cab ride, Oswald also admitted that he left the\r\nslow-moving bus and took a cab to his roominghouse.[C4-485]\r\n\r\nThe Greyhound Bus Station at Lamar and Jackson Streets, where Oswald\r\nentered Whaley\u2019s cab, is three to four short blocks south of Lamar and\r\nElm.[C4-486] If Oswald left the bus at 12:44 p.m. and walked directly\r\nto the terminal, he would have entered the cab at 12:47 or 12:48 p.m.\r\nIf the cab ride was approximately 6 minutes, as was the reconstructed\r\nride, he would have reached his destination at approximately 12:54\r\np.m. If he was discharged at Neely and Beckley and walked directly to\r\nhis

On Friday, November 22, about 1 p.m., he entered the house\r\nin unusual haste. She recalled that it was subsequent to the time\r\nthe President had been shot. After a friend had called and told her,\r\n\u201cPresident Kennedy has been shot,\u201d she turned on the television. When\r\nOswald came in she said, \u201cOh, you are in a hurry,\u201d but Oswald did\r\nnot respond. He hurried to his room and stayed no longer than 3 or 4\r\nminutes. Oswald had entered the house in his shirt sleeves, but when he\r\nleft, he was zipping up a jacket.

As Tippit reached the left front wheel the man pulled out a\r\nrevolver and fired several shots. Four bullets hit Tippit and killed\r\nhim instantly.

He had not seen Oswald on television and had not been shown\r\nany photographs of Oswald by the police.[C4-506]\r\n\r\nAnother witness, Domingo Benavides, was driving a pickup truck west on\r\n10th Street. As he crossed the intersection a block east of 10th and\r\nPatton, he saw a policeman standing by the left door of the police car\r\nparked along the south side of 10th. Benavides saw a man standing at\r\nthe right side of the parked police car. He then heard three shots and\r\nsaw the policeman fall to the ground. By this time the pickup truck\r\nwas across the street and about 25 feet from the police car. Benavides\r\nstopped and waited in the truck until the gunman ran to the corner.\r\nHe saw him empty the gun and throw the shells into some bushes on the\r\nsoutheast corner lot.[C4-507] It was Benavides, using Tippit\u2019s car\r\nradio, who first reported the killing of Patrolman Tippit at about\r\n1:16 p.m.: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a shooting out here.\u201d[C4-508] He found two empty\r\nshells in the bushes and gave them to Patrolman J.\u00a0M. Poe who arrived\r\non the scene shortly after the shooting.[C4-509] Benavides never saw\r\nOswald after the arrest. When questioned by police officers on the\r\nevening of November 22, Benavides told them that he did not think that\r\nhe could identify the man who fired the shots. As a result, they did\r\nnot take him to the police station. He testified that the picture of\r\nOswald which he saw later on television bore a resemblance to the man\r\nwho shot Officer Tippit.[C4-510]\r\n\r\nJust prior to the shooting, Mrs. Helen Markham, a waitress in\r\ndowntown Dallas, was about to cross 10th Street at Patton. As she\r\nwaited on the northwest corner of the intersection for traffic to\r\npass,[C4-511] she noticed a young man as he was \u201calmost ready to get\r\nup on the curb\u201d[C4-512] at the southeast corner of the intersection,\r\napproximately 50 feet away. The man continued along 10th Street. Mrs.\r\nMarkham saw a police car slowly approach the man from the rear and\r\nstop alongside of him. She saw the man come to the right window of the\r\npolice car. As he talked, he leaned on the ledge of the right window\r\nwith his arms. The man appeared to step back as the policeman \u201ccalmly\r\nopened the car door\u201d and very slowly got out and walked toward the\r\nfront of the car. The man pulled a gun. Mrs. Markham heard three shots\r\nand saw the policeman fall to the ground near the left front wheel. She\r\nraised her hands to her eyes as the man started to walk back toward\r\nPatton.[C4-513] She peered through her fingers, lowered her hands, and\r\nsaw the man doing something with his gun. \u201cHe was just fooling with it.\r\nI didn\u2019t know what he was doing. I was afraid he was fixing to kill\r\nme.\u201d[C4-514] The man \u201cin kind of a little trot\u201d headed down Patton\r\ntoward Jefferson Boulevard, a block away. Mrs. Markham then ran to\r\nOfficer Tippit\u2019s side and saw him lying in a pool of blood.[C4-515]\r\n\r\nHelen Markham was screaming as she leaned over the body.", "start_char_idx": 440822, "end_char_idx": 444640, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e3b13bd-ef2b-41e8-8893-8784344b6988": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e3b13bd-ef2b-41e8-8893-8784344b6988", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8aea3dde-dabf-4f53-9e88-c0aa708eae38", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "89dc8822c52d2e9e3fc28b3ccf9a4048853ef591313774cbbf540436e99c5827", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc12a332-b825-4b15-b4f2-cda8f484b210", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc486c447e6096fa0d7ebb8ca62ddbb4684e6777aedc13fafbc6b2eda4921148", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The man pulled a gun.

Graves, who had been with Mrs. Markham before the\r\nlineup testified that she was \u201cquite hysterical\u201d and was \u201ccrying\r\nand upset.\u201d[C4-521] He said that Mrs. Markham started crying when\r\nOswald walked into the lineup room.[C4-522] In testimony before the\r\nCommission, Mrs. Markham confirmed her positive identification of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald as the man she saw kill Officer Tippit.[C4-523]\r\n\r\nIn evaluating Mrs. Markham\u2019s identification of Oswald, the Commission\r\nconsidered certain allegations that Mrs. Markham described the man\r\nwho killed Patrolman Tippit as \u201cshort, a little on the heavy side,\u201d\r\nand having \u201csomewhat bushy\u201d hair.[C4-524] The Commission reviewed the\r\ntranscript of a phone conversation in which Mrs. Markham is alleged\r\nto have provided such a description.[C4-525] A review of the complete\r\ntranscript has satisfied the Commission that Mrs. Markham strongly\r\nreaffirmed her positive identification of Oswald and denied having\r\ndescribed the killer as short, stocky and having bushy hair. She\r\nstated that the man weighed about 150 pounds.[C4-526] Although she\r\nused the words \u201ca little bit bushy\u201d to describe the gunman\u2019s hair,\r\nthe transcript establishes that she was referring to the uncombed\r\nstate of his hair, a description fully supported by a photograph of\r\nOswald taken at the time of his arrest. (See Pizzo Exhibit No. 453-C,\r\np. 177.) Although in the phone conversation she described the man as\r\n\u201cshort,\u201d[C4-527] on November 22, within minutes of the shooting and\r\nbefore the lineup, Mrs. Markham described the man to the police as 5\u20198\u201d\r\ntall.[C4-528]\r\n\r\nDuring her testimony Mrs. Markham initially denied that she ever had\r\nthe above phone conversation.[C4-529] She has subsequently admitted\r\nthe existence of the conversation and offered an explanation for her\r\ndenial.[C4-530] Addressing itself solely to the probative value of Mrs.\r\nMarkham\u2019s contemporaneous description of the gunman and her positive\r\nidentification of Oswald at a police lineup, the Commission considers\r\nher testimony reliable.

Reynolds and\r\nPatterson decided to follow him. When he reached a gasoline service\r\nstation one block away he turned north and walked toward a parking\r\narea in the rear of the station. Neither Reynolds nor Patterson saw\r\nthe man after he turned off Jefferson at the service station.[C4-564]\r\nThese four witnesses were interviewed by FBI agents 2 months after\r\nthe shooting.

(See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 143, p. 170). Two of the arresting officers placed their\r\ninitials on the weapon and a third inscribed his name. All three\r\nidentified Exhibit No. 143 as the revolver taken from Oswald when he\r\nwas arrested.[C4-569] Four cartridge cases were found in the shrubbery\r\non the corner of 10th and Patton by three of the eyewitnesses--Domingo\r\nBenavides, Barbara Jeanette Davis, and Virginia Davis.[C4-570] It was\r\nthe unanimous and unequivocal testimony of expert witnesses before the\r\nCommission that these used cartridge cases were fired from the revolver\r\nin Oswald\u2019s possession to the exclusion of all other weapons. (See app.\r\nX, p. 559.)\r\n\r\nCortlandt Cunningham, of the Firearms Identification Unit of the\r\nFBI Laboratory, testified that he compared the four empty cartridge\r\ncases found near the scene of the shooting with a test cartridge\r\nfired from the weapon in Oswald\u2019s possession when he was arrested.\r\nCunningham declared that this weapon fired the four cartridges to the\r\nexclusion of all other weapons. Identification was effected through\r\nbreech face marks and firing pin marks.[C4-571] Robert A. Frazier and\r\nCharles Killion, other FBI firearms experts, independently examined\r\nthe four cartridge cases and arrived at the same conclusion as\r\nCunningham.[C4-572] At the request of the Commission, Joseph D. Nicol,\r\nsuperintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal Identification\r\nInvestigation, also examined the four cartridge cases found near the\r\nsite of the homicide and compared them with the test cartridge cases\r\nfired from the Smith & Wesson revolver taken from Oswald. He concluded\r\nthat all of these cartridges were fired from the same weapon.[C4-573]\r\n\r\nCunningham compared four lead bullets recovered from the body\r\nof Patrolman Tippit with test bullets fired from Oswald\u2019s\r\nrevolver.[C4-574] He explained that the bullets were slightly smaller\r\nthan the barrel of the pistol which had fired them. This caused the\r\nbullets to have an erratic passage through the barrel and impressed\r\nupon the lead of the bullets inconsistent individual characteristics\r\nwhich made identification impossible. Consecutive bullets fired from\r\nthe revolver by the FBI experts could not be identified as having been\r\nfired from that revolver.[C4-575] (See app. X, p. 559.) Cunningham\r\ntestified that all of the bullets were mutilated, one being useless\r\nfor comparison purposes. All four bullets were fired from a weapon\r\nwith five lands and grooves and a right twist[C4-576] which were\r\nthe rifling characteristics of the revolver taken from Oswald.

Marina Oswald stated\r\nthat her husband owned only two jackets, one blue and the other\r\ngray.[C4-607] The blue jacket was found in the Texas School Book\r\nDepository[C4-608] and was identified by Marina Oswald as her\r\nhusband\u2019s.[C4-609] Marina Oswald also identified Commission Exhibit No.\r\n162, the jacket found by Captain Westbrook, as her husband\u2019s second\r\njacket.[C4-610]\r\n\r\nThe eyewitnesses vary in their identification of the jacket. Mrs.\r\nEarlene Roberts, the housekeeper at Oswald\u2019s roominghouse and the last\r\nperson known to have seen him before he reached 10th Street and Patton\r\nAvenue, said that she may have seen the gray zipper jacket but she was\r\nnot certain.

One of the persons who heard the sirens was Johnny Calvin\r\nBrewer, manager of Hardy\u2019s Shoestore, a few doors east of the Texas\r\nTheatre. Brewer knew from radio broadcasts that the President had been\r\nshot and that a patrolman had also been shot in Oak Cliff.[C4-616]\r\nWhen he heard police sirens, he \u201clooked up and saw the man enter the\r\nlobby,\u201d a recessed area extending about 15 feet between the sidewalk\r\nand the front door of his store.[C4-617] A police car made a =U=-turn,\r\nand as the sirens grew fainter, the man in the lobby \u201clooked over his\r\nshoulder and turned around and walked up West Jefferson towards the\r\ntheatre.\u201d[C4-618] The man wore a T-shirt beneath his outer shirt and he\r\nhad no jacket.[C4-619] Brewer said, \u201cHe just looked funny to me. * * *\r\nHis hair was sort of messed up and looked like he had been running, and\r\nhe looked scared, and he looked funny.\u201d[C4-620]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (HILL EXHIBIT B) OSWALD IN FRONT OF TEXAS THEATER\r\n\r\n(FRANK PIZZO EXHIBIT 453-C)\r\n\r\nOSWALD AT DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1797\r\n\r\nOSWALD AT DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT]\r\n\r\nMrs. Julia Postal, selling tickets at the box office of the Texas\r\nTheatre, heard police sirens and then saw a man as he \u201cducked into\u201d\r\nthe outer lobby space of the theatre near the ticket office.[C4-621]\r\nAttracted by the sound of the sirens, Mrs. Postal stepped out of the\r\nbox office and walked to the curb.[C4-622] Shortly thereafter, Johnny\r\nBrewer, who had come from the nearby shoestore, asked Mrs. Postal\r\nwhether the fellow that had ducked in had bought a ticket.[C4-623] She\r\nsaid, \u201cNo;

George Jefferson Applin, Jr., confirmed that Oswald\r\nfought with four or five officers before he was handcuffed.[C4-654] He\r\nadded that one officer grabbed the muzzle of a shotgun, drew back, and\r\nhit Oswald with the butt end of the gun in the back.[C4-655] No other\r\ntheatre patron or officer has testified that Oswald was hit by a gun.\r\nNor did Oswald ever complain that he was hit with a gun, or injured in\r\nthe back. Deputy Sheriff Walthers brought a shotgun into the theatre\r\nbut laid it on some seats before helping to subdue Oswald.[C4-656]\r\nOfficer Ray Hawkins said that there was no one near Oswald who had a\r\nshotgun and he saw no one strike Oswald in the back with a rifle butt\r\nor the butt of a gun.[C4-657]\r\n\r\nJohn Gibson, another patron in the theatre, saw an officer grab Oswald,\r\nand he claims that he heard the click of a gun misfiring.[C4-658] He\r\nsaw no shotgun in the possession of any policeman near Oswald.[C4-659]\r\nJohnny Brewer testified he saw Oswald pull the revolver and the\r\nofficers struggle with him to take it away but that once he was\r\nsubdued, no officer struck him.[C4-660] He further stated that\r\nwhile fists were flying he heard one of the officers say \u201cKill the\r\nPresident, will you.\u201d[C4-661] It is unlikely that any of the police\r\nofficers referred to Oswald as a suspect in the assassination. While\r\nthe police radio had noted the similarity in description of the two\r\nsuspects, the arresting officers were pursuing Oswald for the murder\r\nof Tippit.[C4-662] As Oswald, handcuffed, was led from the theatre, he\r\nwas, according to McDonald, \u201ccursing a little bit and hollering police\r\nbrutality.\u201d[C4-663] At 1:51 p.m., police car 2 reported by radio that\r\nit was on the way to headquarters with the suspect.[C4-664]\r\n\r\nCaptain Fritz returned to police headquarters from the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository at 2:15 after a brief stop at the sheriff\u2019s\r\noffice.[C4-665] When he entered the homicide and robbery bureau office,\r\nhe saw two detectives standing there with Sgt. Gerald L. Hill, who had\r\ndriven from the theatre with Oswald.[C4-666] Hill testified that Fritz\r\ntold the detective to get a search warrant, go to an address on Fifth\r\nStreet in Irving, and pick up a man named Lee Oswald.

Throughout\r\nthis interrogation he denied that he had anything to do either with\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy or the murder of Patrolman\r\nTippit. Captain Fritz of the homicide and robbery bureau did most of\r\nthe questioning, but he kept no notes and there were no stenographic\r\nor tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies\r\nwere also present, including the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service. They\r\noccasionally participated in the questioning. The reports prepared by\r\nthose present at these interviews are set forth in appendix XI. A full\r\ndiscussion of Oswald\u2019s detention and interrogation is presented in\r\nchapter V of this report.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening of November 22, the Dallas Police Department\r\nperformed paraffin tests on Oswald\u2019s hands and right cheek in an\r\napparent effort to determine, by means of a scientific test, whether\r\nOswald had recently fired a weapon. The results were positive for\r\nthe hands and negative for the right cheek.[C4-669] Expert testimony\r\nbefore the Commission was to the effect that the paraffin test was\r\nunreliable[C4-670] in determining whether or not a person has fired a\r\nrifle or revolver.[C4-671] The Commission has, therefore, placed no\r\nreliance on the paraffin tests administered by the Dallas police. (See\r\napp. X, pp. 561-562.)\r\n\r\nOswald provided little information during his questioning. Frequently,\r\nhowever, he was confronted with evidence which he could not explain,\r\nand he resorted to statements which are known to be lies.[C4-672] While\r\nOswald\u2019s untrue statements during interrogation were not considered\r\nitems of positive proof by the Commission, they had probative value in\r\ndeciding the weight to be given to his denials that he assassinated\r\nPresident Kennedy and killed Patrolman Tippit. Since independent\r\nevidence revealed that Oswald repeatedly and blatantly lied to the\r\npolice, the Commission gave little weight to his denials of guilt.\r\n\r\n\r\nDenial of Rifle Ownership\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, Oswald denied owning a rifle. On November 23, Fritz\r\nconfronted Oswald with the evidence that he had purchased a rifle under\r\nthe fictitious name of \u201cHidell.\u201d Oswald said that this was not true.\r\nOswald denied that he had a rifle wrapped up in a blanket in the Paine\r\ngarage. Oswald also denied owning a rifle and said that since leaving\r\nthe Marine Corps he had fired only a small bore .22 rifle.[C4-673] On\r\nthe afternoon of November 23, Officers H.\u00a0M. Moore, R.\u00a0S. Stovall, and\r\nG.\u00a0F. Rose obtained a search warrant and examined Oswald\u2019s effects in\r\nthe Paine garage. They discovered two photographs, each showing Oswald\r\nwith a rifle and a pistol.[C4-674] These photographs were shown to\r\nOswald on the evening of November 23 and again on the morning of the\r\n24th. According to Fritz, Oswald sneered, saying that they were fake\r\nphotographs, that he had been photographed a number of times the day\r\nbefore by the police, that they had superimposed upon the photographs\r\na rifle and a revolver.[C4-675] He told Fritz a number of times that\r\nthe smaller photograph was either made from the larger, or the larger\r\nphotograph was made from the smaller and that at the proper time he\r\nwould show that the pictures were fakes. Fritz told him that the two\r\nsmall photographs were found in the Paine garage. At that point,\r\nOswald refused to answer any further questions.[C4-676] As previously\r\nindicated, Marina Oswald testified that she took the two pictures with\r\nher husband\u2019s Imperial Reflex camera when they lived on Neely Street.", "start_char_idx": 475340, "end_char_idx": 479454, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99108f82-a4e9-4e39-a427-f31c78067c06": {"__data__": {"id_": "99108f82-a4e9-4e39-a427-f31c78067c06", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0a59035-3e5f-4318-b215-3a2b1317ab1a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "9c47eb0900a2a61483a75444b0c67bdd0a54fc2619c279940cd8bb9d500cf1e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "74a818be-350a-4f95-a87b-f1b53b8ca358", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d213f7ae4b200408faf3b45b02c24d68813037a7ae8cacb32552dd30a156c471", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "According to Fritz, Oswald sneered, saying that they were fake\r\nphotographs, that he had been photographed a number of times the day\r\nbefore by the police, that they had superimposed upon the photographs\r\na rifle and a revolver.[C4-675] He told Fritz a number of times that\r\nthe smaller photograph was either made from the larger, or the larger\r\nphotograph was made from the smaller and that at the proper time he\r\nwould show that the pictures were fakes.

When Captain Fritz asked him why\r\nhe carried the revolver, he answered, \u201cWell, you know about a pistol.\r\nI just carried it.\u201d[C4-678] He falsely alleged that he bought the\r\nrevolver in Fort Worth,[C4-679] when in fact he purchased it from a\r\nmail-order house in Los Angeles.[C4-680]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Aliases \u201cHidell\u201d and \u201cO.\u00a0H. Lee\u201d\r\n\r\nThe arresting officers found a forged selective service card with\r\na picture of Oswald and the name \u201cAlek J. Hidell\u201d in Oswald\u2019s\r\nbillfold.[C4-681] On November 22 and 23, Oswald refused to tell Fritz\r\nwhy this card was in his possession,[C4-682] or to answer any questions\r\nconcerning the card.[C4-683] On Sunday morning, November 24, Oswald\r\ndenied that he knew A.\u00a0J. Hidell. Captain Fritz produced the selective\r\nservice card bearing the name \u201cAlek J. Hidell.\u201d Oswald became angry\r\nand said, \u201cNow, I\u2019ve told you all I\u2019m going to tell you about that\r\ncard in my billfold--you have the card yourself and you know as much\r\nabout it as I do.\u201d[C4-684] At the last interrogation on November 24,\r\nOswald admitted to Postal Inspector Holmes that he had rented post\r\noffice box 2915, Dallas, but denied that he had received a package\r\nin this box addressed to Hidell. He also denied that he had received\r\nthe rifle through this box.[C4-685] Holmes reminded Oswald that A.\u00a0J.\r\nHidell was listed on post office box 30061, New Orleans, as one\r\nentitled to receive mail. Oswald replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about\r\nthat.\u201d[C4-686]\r\n\r\nWhen asked why he lived at his roominghouse under the name O.\u00a0H. Lee,\r\nOswald responded that the landlady simply made a mistake, because he\r\ntold her that his name was Lee, meaning his first name.[C4-687] An\r\nexamination of the roominghouse register revealed that Oswald actually\r\nsigned the name O.\u00a0H. Lee.[C4-688]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Curtain Rod Story\r\n\r\nIn concluding that Oswald was carrying a rifle in the paper bag on the\r\nmorning of November 22, 1963, the Commission found that Oswald lied\r\nwhen he told Frazier that he was returning to Irving to obtain curtain\r\nrods. When asked about the curtain rod story, Oswald lied again. He\r\ndenied that he had ever told Frazier that he wanted a ride to Irving\r\nto get curtain rods for an apartment.[C4-689] He explained that a\r\nparty for the Paine children had been planned for the weekend and he\r\npreferred not to be in the Paine house at that time; therefore, he made\r\nhis weekly visit on Thursday night.[C4-690] Actually, the party for one\r\nof the Paine\u2019s children was the preceding weekend, when Marina Oswald\r\nsuggested that Oswald remain in Dallas.[C4-691] When told that Frazier\r\nand Mrs. Randle had seen him carrying a long heavy package, Oswald\r\nreplied, \u201cWell, they was mistaken.

He stated that at the time the President was\r\nshot he was having lunch with \u201cJunior\u201d but he did not give Junior\u2019s\r\nlast name.[C4-697] The only employee at the Depository Building named\r\n\u201cJunior\u201d was James Jarman, Jr. Jarman testified that he ate his lunch\r\non the first floor around 5 minutes to 12, and that he neither ate\r\nlunch with nor saw Oswald.[C4-698] Jarman did talk to Oswald that\r\nmorning:\r\n\r\n    * * * he asked me what were the people gathering around on the\r\n    corner for and I told him that the President was supposed to\r\n    pass that morning, and he asked me did I know which way he was\r\n    coming, and I told him, yes, he probably come down Main and\r\n    turn on Houston and then back again on Elm. Then he said, \u201cOh,\r\n    I see,\u201d and that was all.[C4-699]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIOR ATTEMPT TO KILL\r\n\r\nThe Attempt on the Life of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n\r\nAt approximately 9 p.m., on April 10, 1963, in Dallas, Tex., Maj. Gen.\r\nEdwin A. Walker, an active and controversial figure on the American\r\npolitical scene since his resignation from the U.S. Army in 1961,\r\nnarrowly escaped death when a rifle bullet fired from outside his\r\nhome passed near his head as he was seated at his desk.[C4-700] There\r\nwere no eyewitnesses, although a 14-year-old boy in a neighboring\r\nhouse claimed that immediately after the shooting he saw two men, in\r\nseparate cars, drive out of a church parking lot adjacent to Walker\u2019s\r\nhome.[C4-701] A friend of Walker\u2019s testified that two nights before the\r\nshooting he saw \u201ctwo men around the house peeking in windows.\u201d[C4-702]\r\nGeneral Walker gave this information to the police before the shooting,\r\nbut it did not help solve the crime. Although the bullet was recovered\r\nfrom Walker\u2019s house (see app. X, p. 562), in the absence of a weapon\r\nit was of little investigatory value. General Walker hired two\r\ninvestigators to determine whether a former employee might have been\r\ninvolved in the shooting.[C4-703] Their results were negative.

In translation, the note read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    1. This is the key to the mailbox which is located in the main\r\n    post office in the city on Ervay Street. This is the same\r\n    street where the drugstore, in which you always waited is\r\n    located. You will find the mailbox in the post office which is\r\n    located 4 blocks from the drugstore on that street. I paid for\r\n    the box last month so don\u2019t worry about it.\r\n\r\n    2. Send the information as to what has happened to me to\r\n    the Embassy and include newspaper clippings (should there\r\n    be anything about me in the newspapers). I believe that the\r\n    Embassy will come quickly to your assistance on learning\r\n    everything.\r\n\r\n    3. I paid the house rent on the 2d so don\u2019t worry about it.\r\n\r\n    4. Recently I also paid for water and gas.\r\n\r\n    5. The money from work will possibly be coming. The money will\r\n    be sent to our post office box. Go to the bank and cash the\r\n    check.\r\n\r\n    6. You can either throw out or give my clothing, etc. away.\r\n    Do not keep these. However, I prefer that you hold on to my\r\n    personal papers (military, civil, etc.).\r\n\r\n    7. Certain of my documents are in the small blue valise.\r\n\r\n    8. The address book can be found on my table in the study\r\n    should need same.\r\n\r\n    9. We have friends here. The Red Cross also will help you. (Red\r\n    Cross in English). [sic]\r\n\r\n    10. I left you as much money as I could, $60 on the second of\r\n    the month. You and the baby [apparently] can live for another 2\r\n    months using $10 per week.\r\n\r\n    11. If I am alive and taken prisoner, the city jail is located\r\n    at the end of the bridge through which we always passed on\r\n    going to the city (right in the beginning of the city after\r\n    crossing the bridge).[C4-705]\r\n\r\nJames C.

He only told me he had shot\r\nat General Walker.\u201d[C4-709] Oswald told his wife that he did not know\r\nwhether he had hit Walker; according to Marina Oswald when he learned\r\non the radio and in the newspapers the next day that he had missed,\r\nhe said that he \u201cwas very sorry that he had not hit him.\u201d[C4-710]\r\nMarina Oswald\u2019s testimony was fully supported by the note itself which\r\nappeared to be the work of a man expecting to be killed, or imprisoned,\r\nor to disappear. The last paragraph directed her to the jail and the\r\nother paragraphs instructed her on the disposal of Oswald\u2019s personal\r\neffects and the management of her affairs if he should not return.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the note was written while the Oswalds were living\r\nin Dallas before they moved to New Orleans in the spring of 1963. The\r\nreferences to house rent and payments for water and gas indicated that\r\nthe note was written when they were living in a rented apartment;\r\ntherefore it could not have been written while Marina Oswald was living\r\nwith the Paines. Moreover, the reference in paragraph 3 to paying \u201cthe\r\nhouse rent on the 2d\u201d would be consistent with the period when the\r\nOswalds were living on Neely Street since the apartment was rented on\r\nMarch 3, 1963. Oswald had paid the first month\u2019s rent in advance on\r\nMarch 2, 1963, and the second month\u2019s rent was paid on either April\r\n2 or April 3.[C4-711] The main post office \u201con Ervay Street\u201d refers\r\nto the post office where Oswald rented box 2915 from October 9, 1962,\r\nto May 14, 1963.[C4-712] Another statement which limits the time\r\nwhen it could have been written is the reference \u201cyou and the baby,\u201d\r\nwhich would indicate that it was probably written before the birth of\r\nOswald\u2019s second child on October 20, 1963.\r\n\r\nOswald had apparently mistaken the county jail for the city jail.\r\nFrom Neely Street the Oswalds would have traveled downtown on the\r\nBeckley bus, across the Commerce Street viaduct and into downtown\r\nDallas through the Triple Underpass.[C4-713] Either the viaduct or the\r\nunderpass might have been the \u201cbridge\u201d mentioned in the last paragraph\r\nof the note. The county jail is at the corner of Houston and Main\r\nStreets \u201cright in the beginning of the city\u201d after one travels through\r\nthe underpass.\r\n\r\n_Photographs._--In her testimony before the Commission in February\r\n1964, Marina Oswald stated that when Oswald returned home on the\r\nnight of the Walker shooting, he told her that he had been planning\r\nthe attempt for 2 months. He showed her a notebook 3 days later\r\ncontaining photographs of General Walker\u2019s home and a map of the area\r\nwhere the house was located.[C4-714] Although Oswald destroyed the\r\nnotebook,[C4-715] three photographs found among Oswald\u2019s possessions\r\nafter the assassination were identified by Marina Oswald as photographs\r\nof General Walker\u2019s house.[C4-716] Two of these photographs were taken\r\nfrom the rear of Walker\u2019s house.[C4-717] The Commission confirmed, by\r\ncomparison with other photographs, that these were, indeed, photographs\r\nof the rear of Walker\u2019s house.[C4-718] An examination of the window at\r\nthe rear of the house, the wall through which the bullet passed, and\r\nthe fence behind the house indicated that the bullet was fired from a\r\nposition near the point where one of the photographs was taken.[C4-719]\r\n\r\nThe third photograph identified by Marina Oswald depicts the entrance\r\nto General Walker\u2019s driveway from a back alley.", "start_char_idx": 488155, "end_char_idx": 492349, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "216a4d7f-e261-4c1c-90aa-5136dd9fd425": {"__data__": {"id_": "216a4d7f-e261-4c1c-90aa-5136dd9fd425", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b697b387-a02b-4442-a959-850f1ea304a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "8bd06a34e82acfbd96ea378a12533bcc7b1779103d4e27b87e425762c23f94b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e651d62d-e20c-432e-95b8-eb1eac407274", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f5d310fcedde955b3c0903ba6b0fa0eaf91d61aed350f764b7319d2e9a62f9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C4-714] Although Oswald destroyed the\r\nnotebook,[C4-715] three photographs found among Oswald\u2019s possessions\r\nafter the assassination were identified by Marina Oswald as photographs\r\nof General Walker\u2019s house.[C4-716] Two of these photographs were taken\r\nfrom the rear of Walker\u2019s house.[C4-717] The Commission confirmed, by\r\ncomparison with other photographs, that these were, indeed, photographs\r\nof the rear of Walker\u2019s house.[C4-718] An examination of the window at\r\nthe rear of the house, the wall through which the bullet passed, and\r\nthe fence behind the house indicated that the bullet was fired from a\r\nposition near the point where one of the photographs was taken.[C4-719]\r\n\r\nThe third photograph identified by Marina Oswald depicts the entrance\r\nto General Walker\u2019s driveway from a back alley.[C4-720] Also seen\r\nin the picture is the fence on which Walker\u2019s assailant apparently\r\nrested the rifle.[C4-721] An examination of certain construction work\r\nappearing in the background of this photograph revealed that the\r\npicture was taken between March 8 and 12, 1963, and most probably on\r\neither March 9 or March 10.[C4-722] Oswald purchased the money order\r\nfor the rifle on March 12, the rifle was shipped on March 20,[C4-723]\r\nand the shooting occurred on April 10. A photography expert with\r\nthe FBI was able to determine that this picture was taken with the\r\nImperial Reflex camera owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-724] (See app. X,\r\np. 596.)\r\n\r\nA fourth photograph, showing a stretch of railroad tracks, was\r\nalso identified by Marina Oswald as having been taken by her\r\nhusband, presumably in connection with the Walker shooting.[C4-725]\r\nInvestigation determined that this photograph was taken approximately\r\nseven-tenths of a mile from Walker\u2019s house.[C4-726] Another photograph\r\nof railroad tracks found among Oswald\u2019s possessions was not identified\r\nby his wife, but investigation revealed that it was taken from a point\r\nslightly less than half a mile from General Walker\u2019s house.[C4-727]\r\nMarina Oswald stated that when she asked her husband what he had done\r\nwith the rifle, he replied that he had buried it in the ground or\r\nhidden it in some bushes and that he also mentioned a railroad track in\r\nthis connection. She testified that several days later Oswald recovered\r\nhis rifle and brought it back to their apartment.[C4-728]\r\n\r\n_Firearms identification._--In the room beyond the one in which General\r\nWalker was sitting on the night of the shooting the Dallas police\r\nrecovered a badly mutilated bullet which had come to rest on a stack of\r\npaper.[C4-729] The Dallas City-County Investigation Laboratory tried to\r\ndetermine the type of weapon which fired the bullet. The oral report\r\nwas negative because of the battered condition of the bullet.[C4-730]\r\nOn November 30, 1963, the FBI requested the bullet for ballistics\r\nexamination; the Dallas Police Department forwarded it on December 2,\r\n1963.[C4-731]\r\n\r\nRobert A. Frazier, an FBI ballistics identification expert, testified\r\nthat he was \u201cunable to reach a conclusion\u201d as to whether or not the\r\nbullet recovered from Walker\u2019s house had been fired from the rifle\r\nfound on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\nHe concluded that \u201cthe general rifling characteristics of the rifle\r\n* * * are of the same type as those found on the bullet * * * and,\r\nfurther, on this basis * * * the bullet could have been fired from the\r\nrifle on the basis of its land and groove impressions.\u201d[C4-732] Frazier\r\ntestified further that the FBI avoids the category of \u201cprobable\u201d\r\nidentification. Unless the missile or cartridge case can be identified\r\nas coming from a particular weapon to the exclusion of all others, the\r\nFBI refuses to draw any conclusion as to probability.[C4-733] Frazier\r\ntestified, however, that he found no microscopic characteristics or\r\nother evidence which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from\r\nthe Mannlicher-Carcano rifle owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.

Nicol, superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal\r\nIdentification and Investigation, conducted an independent examination\r\nof this bullet and concluded \u201cthat there is a fair probability\u201d that\r\nthe bullet was fired from the rifle used in the assassination of\r\nPresident Kennedy.[C4-735] In explaining the difference between his\r\npolicy and that of the FBI on the matter of probable identification,\r\nNicol said:\r\n\r\n    I am aware of their position. This is not, I am sure, arrived\r\n    at without careful consideration. However, to say that because\r\n    one does not find sufficient marks for identification that\r\n    it is a negative, I think is going overboard in the other\r\n    direction. And for purposes of probative value, for whatever\r\n    it might be worth, in the absence of very definite negative\r\n    evidence, I think it is permissible to say that in an exhibit\r\n    such as 573 there is enough on it to say that it could have\r\n    come, and even perhaps a little stronger, to say that it\r\n    probably came from this, without going so far as to say to the\r\n    exclusion of all other guns. This I could not do.[C4-736]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Commission recognizes that neither expert was able to\r\nstate that the bullet which missed General Walker was fired from\r\nOswald\u2019s rifle to the exclusion of all others, this testimony was\r\nconsidered probative when combined with the other testimony linking\r\nOswald to the shooting.\r\n\r\n_Additional corroborative evidence._--The admissions made to Marina\r\nOswald by her husband are an important element in the evidence that Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald fired the shot at General Walker. As shown above, the\r\nnote and the photographs of Walker\u2019s house and of the nearby railroad\r\ntracks provide important corroboration for her account of the incident.\r\nOther details described by Marina Oswald coincide with facts developed\r\nindependently of her statements. She testified that her husband had\r\npostponed his attempt to kill Walker until that Wednesday because he\r\nhad heard that there was to be a gathering at the church next door\r\nto Walker\u2019s house on that evening. He indicated that he wanted more\r\npeople in the vicinity at the time of the attempt so that his arrival\r\nand departure would not attract great attention.[C4-737] An official\r\nof this church told FBI agents that services are held every Wednesday\r\nat the church except during the month of August.[C4-738] Marina Oswald\r\nalso testified that her husband had used a bus to return home.[C4-739]\r\nA study of the bus routes indicates that Oswald could have taken any\r\none of several different buses to Walker\u2019s house or to a point near the\r\nrailroad tracks where he may have concealed the rifle.[C4-740] It would\r\nhave been possible for him to take different routes in approaching and\r\nleaving the scene of the shooting.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._--Based on (1) the contents of the note which Oswald\r\nleft for his wife on April 10, 1963, (2) the photographs found among\r\nOswald\u2019s possessions, (3) the testimony of firearms identification\r\nexperts, and (4) the testimony of Marina Oswald, the Commission has\r\nconcluded that Lee Harvey Oswald attempted to take the life of Maj.\r\nGen. Edwin A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army) on April 10, 1963. The\r\nfinding that Lee Harvey Oswald attempted to murder a public figure in\r\nApril 1963 was considered of probative value in this investigation,\r\nalthough the Commission\u2019s conclusion concerning the identity of the\r\nassassin was based on evidence independent of the finding that Oswald\r\nattempted to kill General Walker.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard M. Nixon Incident\r\n\r\nAnother alleged threat by Oswald against a public figure involved\r\nformer Vice President Richard M. Nixon.

Nixon Incident\r\n\r\nAnother alleged threat by Oswald against a public figure involved\r\nformer Vice President Richard M. Nixon. In January 1964, Marina Oswald\r\nand her business manager, James Martin, told Robert Oswald, Lee Harvey\r\nOswald\u2019s brother, that Oswald had once threatened to shoot former\r\nVice President Richard M. Nixon.[C4-741] When Marina Oswald testified\r\nbefore the Commission on February 3-6, 1964, she had failed to mention\r\nthe incident when she was asked whether Oswald had ever expressed\r\nany hostility toward any official of the United States.[C4-742] The\r\nCommission first learned of this incident when Robert Oswald related it\r\nto FBI agents on February 19, 1964,[C4-743] and to the Commission on\r\nFebruary 21.[C4-744]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald appeared before the Commission again on June 11, 1964,\r\nand testified that a few days before her husband\u2019s departure from\r\nDallas to New Orleans on April 24, 1963, he finished reading a morning\r\nnewspaper \u201c* * * and put on a good suit. I saw that he took a pistol.\r\nI asked him where he was going, and why he was getting dressed. He\r\nanswered \u2018Nixon is coming. I want to go and have a look.\u2019\u201d He also said\r\nthat he would use the pistol if the opportunity arose.[C4-745] She\r\nreminded him that after the Walker shooting he had promised never to\r\nrepeat such an act. Marina Oswald related the events which followed:\r\n\r\n    I called him into the bathroom and I closed the door and I\r\n    wanted to prevent him and then I started to cry. And I told him\r\n    that he shouldn\u2019t do this, and that he had promised me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I remember that I held him. We actually struggled for several\r\n    minutes and then he quieted down.[C4-746]\r\n\r\nShe stated that it was not physical force which kept him from leaving\r\nthe house. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep him from going out if he really wanted\r\nto.\u201d[C4-747] After further questioning she stated that she might have\r\nbeen confused about shutting him in the bathroom, but that \u201cthere is no\r\ndoubt that he got dressed and got a gun.\u201d[C4-748]\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s revolver was shipped from Los Angeles on March 20,\r\n1963,[C4-749] and he left for New Orleans on April 24, 1963.[C4-750]\r\nNo edition of either Dallas newspaper during the period January 1,\r\n1963, to May 15, 1963, mentioned any proposed visit by Mr. Nixon to\r\nDallas.[C4-751] Mr. Nixon advised the Commission that the only time\r\nhe was in Dallas in 1963 was on November 20-21, 1963.[C4-752] An\r\ninvestigation failed to reveal any invitation extended to Mr. Nixon\r\nduring the period when Oswald\u2019s threat reportedly occurred.[C4-753] The\r\nCommission has concluded, therefore, that regardless of what Oswald may\r\nhave said to his wife he was not actually planning to shoot Mr. Nixon\r\nat that time in Dallas.\r\n\r\nOn April 23, 1963, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was in Dallas for\r\na visit which had been publicized in the Dallas newspapers throughout\r\nApril.[C4-754] The Commission asked Marina Oswald whether she might\r\nhave misunderstood the object of her husband\u2019s threat. She stated,\r\n\u201cthere is no question that in this incident it was a question of\r\nMr. Nixon.\u201d[C4-755] When asked later whether it might have been Mr.\r\nJohnson, she said, \u201cYes, no.

Mr. Johnson was the then Vice President and his visit took\r\nplace on April 23d.[C4-758] This was 1 day before Oswald left for New\r\nOrleans and Marina appeared certain that the Nixon incident \u201cwasn\u2019t the\r\nday before. Perhaps 3 days before.\u201d[C4-759]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald speculated that the incident may have been unrelated to\r\nan actual threat. She said,\r\n\r\n    * * * It might have been that he was just trying to test me.\r\n    He was the kind of person who could try and wound somebody in\r\n    that way. Possibly he didn\u2019t want to go out at all but was just\r\n    doing this all as a sort of joke, not really as a joke but\r\n    rather to simply wound me, to make me feel bad.[C4-760]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of other evidence that Oswald actually intended\r\nto shoot someone at this time, the Commission concluded that the\r\nincident, as described by Marina Oswald, was of no probative value in\r\nthe Commission\u2019s decision concerning the identity of the assassin of\r\nPresident Kennedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD\u2019S RIFLE CAPABILITY\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots which killed\r\nPresident Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally, the Commission\r\nconsidered whether Oswald, using his own rifle, possessed the\r\ncapability to hit his target with two out of three shots under the\r\nconditions described in chapter III. The Commission evaluated (1) the\r\nnature of the shots, (2) Oswald\u2019s Marine training in marksmanship, (3)\r\nhis experience and practice after leaving the Marine Corps, and (4) the\r\naccuracy of the weapon and the quality of the ammunition.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nature of the Shots\r\n\r\nFor a rifleman situated on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building the shots were at a slow-moving target proceeding\r\non a downgrade in virtually a straight line with the alinement of the\r\nassassin\u2019s rifle, at a range of 177 to 266 feet.[C4-761] An aerial\r\nphotograph of Dealey Plaza shows that Elm Street runs at an angle so\r\nthat the President would have been moving in an almost straight line\r\naway from the assassin\u2019s rifle.[C4-762] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n876, p. 33.) In addition, the 3\u00b0 downward slope of Elm Street was of\r\nassistance in eliminating at least some of the adjustment which is\r\nordinarily required when a marksman must raise his rifle as a target\r\nmoves farther away.[C4-763]\r\n\r\nFour marksmanship experts testified before the Commission. Maj.\r\nEugene D. Anderson, assistant head of the Marksmanship Branch of\r\nthe U.S. Marine Corps, testified that the shots which struck the\r\nPresident in the neck and in the head were \u201cnot * * * particularly\r\ndifficult.\u201d[C4-764] Robert A. Frazier, FBI expert in firearms\r\nidentification and training, said:\r\n\r\n    From my own experience in shooting over the years, when you\r\n    shoot at 175 feet or 260 feet, which is less than 100 yards,\r\n    with a telescopic sight, you should not have any difficulty in\r\n    hitting your target.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I mean it requires no training at all to shoot a weapon with a\r\n    telescopic sight once you know that you must put the crosshairs\r\n    on the target and that is all that is necessary.[C4-765]\r\n\r\nRonald Simmons, chief of the U.S. Army Infantry Weapons Evaluation\r\nBranch of the Ballistics Research Laboratory, said: \u201cWell, in order\r\nto achieve three hits, it would not be required that a man be an\r\nexceptional shot.", "start_char_idx": 502035, "end_char_idx": 506166, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63dd19d9-b547-43c7-9d73-be089640d196": {"__data__": {"id_": "63dd19d9-b547-43c7-9d73-be089640d196", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d72464-2b9f-4b59-a719-c366efa41ff1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d2ecd7f34c8b2d8a719ee6781c45360fbf209057dbc94b49fde48c9eee8cc06a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "52b1c2f1-dc0f-4b4c-9fae-9a591b4cd3b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 511442, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "205261fdb4c5a0ac1d164c7a955197d456f612fbc7d928fb12e7a1073cc1257b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I mean it requires no training at all to shoot a weapon with a\r\n    telescopic sight once you know that you must put the crosshairs\r\n    on the target and that is all that is necessary.[C4-765]\r\n\r\nRonald Simmons, chief of the U.S. Army Infantry Weapons Evaluation\r\nBranch of the Ballistics Research Laboratory, said: \u201cWell, in order\r\nto achieve three hits, it would not be required that a man be an\r\nexceptional shot.

It\r\n    just is an aid in seeing in the fact that you only have the one\r\n    element, the crosshair, in relation to the target as opposed to\r\n    iron sights with aligning the sights and then aligning them on\r\n    the target.[C4-770]\r\n\r\nCharacterizing the four-power scope as \u201ca real aid, an extreme aid\u201d\r\nin rapid fire shooting, Sergeant Zahm expressed the opinion that the\r\nshot which struck President Kennedy in the neck at 176.9 to 190.8 feet\r\nwas \u201cvery easy\u201d and the shot which struck the President in the head\r\nat a distance of 265.3 feet was \u201can easy shot.\u201d[C4-771] After viewing\r\nphotographs depicting the alinement of Elm Street in relation to the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building, Zahm stated further:\r\n\r\n    This is a definite advantage to the shooter, the vehicle moving\r\n    directly away from him and the downgra", "start_char_idx": 505708, "end_char_idx": 508226, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54eb9ad8-8f61-4f73-a5f6-357b7ec0ae62": {"__data__": {"id_": "54eb9ad8-8f61-4f73-a5f6-357b7ec0ae62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "852102d1-c7f3-42b5-9713-cbc68923a134", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e35b478da027addda95cfc5a650dde70dadf3d1475a1b361843e10d92be0c97", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\ufeffThe Project Gutenberg eBook of Metamorphosis\r\n    \r\nThis ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\r\nmost other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\r\nwhatsoever.

He lay on his\r\narmour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his\r\nbrown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.\r\nThe bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off\r\nany moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the\r\nrest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to me?\u201d he thought. It wasn\u2019t a dream. His room, a\r\nproper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between\r\nits four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out\r\non the table\u2014Samsa was a travelling salesman\u2014and above it there hung a\r\npicture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and\r\nhoused in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur\r\nhat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered\r\nthe whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\r\n\r\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of\r\nrain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.\r\n\u201cHow about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this\r\nnonsense\u201d, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do\r\nbecause he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state\r\ncouldn\u2019t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his\r\nright, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a\r\nhundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn\u2019t have to look at the\r\nfloundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull\r\npain there that he had never felt before.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, God\u201d, he thought, \u201cwhat a strenuous career it is that I\u2019ve chosen!\r\nTravelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more\r\neffort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there\u2019s\r\nthe curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad\r\nand irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that\r\nyou can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can\r\nall go to Hell!\u201d He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself\r\nslowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his\r\nhead better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with\r\nlots of little white spots which he didn\u2019t know what to make of; and\r\nwhen he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly\r\nback because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\nHe slid back into his former position. \u201cGetting up early all the time\u201d,\r\nhe thought, \u201cit makes you stupid. You\u2019ve got to get enough sleep. Other\r\ntravelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go\r\nback to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,\r\nthese gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.\r\nI ought to just try that with my boss; I\u2019d get kicked out on the spot.\r\nBut who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4046, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "852102d1-c7f3-42b5-9713-cbc68923a134": {"__data__": {"id_": "852102d1-c7f3-42b5-9713-cbc68923a134", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "54eb9ad8-8f61-4f73-a5f6-357b7ec0ae62", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "cfa145860dcc0c379e2e172af64e62d9abc6c549b3a5bff1e0d654682cc28688", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "080e2db1-5c66-448b-bf5b-a148411dd029", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "65878cd97a8d2e3ffb5ff09676e5ad79e9a16c3bc0d53e03c2dcf3ab4e5601f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He slid back into his former position. \u201cGetting up early all the time\u201d,\r\nhe thought, \u201cit makes you stupid.

For instance, whenever I go\r\nback to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,\r\nthese gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.\r\nI ought to just try that with my boss; I\u2019d get kicked out on the spot.\r\nBut who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn\u2019t\r\nhave my parents to think about I\u2019d have given in my notice a long time\r\nago, I\u2019d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell\r\nhim everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He\u2019d fall right\r\noff his desk! And it\u2019s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there\r\nat your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\r\nespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard\r\nof hearing. Well, there\u2019s still some hope; once I\u2019ve got the money\r\ntogether to pay off my parents\u2019 debt to him\u2014another five or six years I\r\nsuppose\u2014that\u2019s definitely what I\u2019ll do. That\u2019s when I\u2019ll make the big\r\nchange. First of all though, I\u2019ve got to get up, my train leaves at\r\nfive.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\r\n\u201cGod in Heaven!\u201d he thought. It was half past six and the hands were\r\nquietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like\r\nquarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the\r\nbed that it had been set for four o\u2019clock as it should have been; it\r\ncertainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep\r\nthrough that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept\r\npeacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What\r\nshould he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch\r\nthat he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was\r\nstill not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and\r\nlively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his\r\nboss\u2019s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the\r\nfive o\u2019clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor\u2019s\r\nnot being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss\u2019s\r\nman, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported\r\nsick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five\r\nyears of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would\r\ncertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance\r\ncompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the\r\ndoctor\u2019s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed\r\nthat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what\u2019s more,\r\nwould he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact,\r\napart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel\r\ncompletely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\r\n\r\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to\r\nget out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a\r\ncautious knock at the door near his head. \u201cGregor\u201d, somebody called\u2014it\r\nwas his mother\u2014\u201cit\u2019s quarter to seven.

As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and\r\nuncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out\r\nat first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear,\r\nleaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor\r\nhad wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the\r\ncircumstances contented himself with saying: \u201cYes, mother, yes,\r\nthank-you, I\u2019m getting up now.\u201d The change in Gregor\u2019s voice probably\r\ncould not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was\r\nsatisfied with this explanation and shuffled away.", "start_char_idx": 3556, "end_char_idx": 7517, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "080e2db1-5c66-448b-bf5b-a148411dd029": {"__data__": {"id_": "080e2db1-5c66-448b-bf5b-a148411dd029", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "852102d1-c7f3-42b5-9713-cbc68923a134", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "2bb020f4de34e513289a31558da61a1ced950f959a4e37ad5a89c8945d319fde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "23a0b341-f803-406c-bb2b-92aceae4880e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9ddf70e9d481d1a7ed00765f6da28aa41aa3ce6e30339dcc40bcdb5cd0a883f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u201cGregor\u201d, somebody called\u2014it\r\nwas his mother\u2014\u201cit\u2019s quarter to seven.

But this short\r\nconversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor,\r\nagainst their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came\r\nknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. \u201cGregor,\r\nGregor\u201d, he called, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d And after a short while he called\r\nagain with a warning deepness in his voice: \u201cGregor! Gregor!\u201d At the\r\nother side door his sister came plaintively: \u201cGregor? Aren\u2019t you well?\r\nDo you need anything?\u201d Gregor answered to both sides: \u201cI\u2019m ready, now\u201d,\r\nmaking an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by\r\nenunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,\r\nindividual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister\r\nwhispered: \u201cGregor, open the door, I beg of you.\u201d Gregor, however, had\r\nno thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for\r\nhis cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors\r\nat night even when he was at home.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\r\ndisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only\r\nthen would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he\r\nwould not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in\r\nbed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps\r\ncaused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure\r\nimagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve\r\nthemselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change\r\nin his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\r\nwhich was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow\r\nhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became\r\ndifficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He\r\nwould have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead\r\nof them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in\r\ndifferent directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If\r\nhe wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would\r\nstretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with\r\nthat leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about\r\npainfully. \u201cThis is something that can\u2019t be done in bed\u201d, Gregor said\r\nto himself, \u201cso don\u2019t keep trying to do it\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out\r\nof the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not\r\nimagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it\r\nwent so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly\r\nshoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose\r\nthe wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned\r\nfrom the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might\r\nwell, at present, be the most sensitive.\r\n\r\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,\r\ncarefully turning his head to the side.

This he managed quite easily,\r\nand despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually\r\nfollowed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last\r\ngot his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him\r\nthat if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not\r\ninjured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the\r\nsame way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better\r\nto stay in bed than lose consciousness.\r\n\r\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier,\r\nbut when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as\r\nthey struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was\r\npossible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this\r\nchaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to\r\nstay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free\r\nof it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time,\r\nthough, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was\r\nmuch better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this\r\nhe would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he\r\ncould, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\r\nenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to\r\noffer him. \u201cSeven o\u2019clock, already\u201d, he said to himself when the clock\r\nstruck again, \u201cseven o\u2019clock, and there\u2019s still a fog like this.\u201d And\r\nhe lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps\r\nexpected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and\r\nnatural state.\r\n\r\nBut then he said to himself: \u201cBefore it strikes quarter past seven I\u2019ll\r\ndefinitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody\r\nwill have come round from work to ask what\u2019s happened to me as well, as\r\nthey open up at work before seven o\u2019clock.\u201d And so he set himself to\r\nthe task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all\r\nat the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and\r\nkept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.\r\nHis back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to\r\nit falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he\r\nwas bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably\r\nraise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.\r\n\r\nWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed\u2014the new method\r\nwas more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and\r\nforth\u2014it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody\r\ncame to help him. Two strong people\u2014he had his father and the maid in\r\nmind\u2014would have been more than enough; they would only have to push\r\ntheir arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend\r\ndown with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over\r\nonto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.\r\nShould he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that\r\nall the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he\r\ncould not suppress a smile at this thought.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have\r\nbeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time\r\nwas now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very\r\nsoon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. \u201cThat\u2019ll be\r\nsomeone from work\u201d, he said to himself, and froze very still, although\r\nhis little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.", "start_char_idx": 9936, "end_char_idx": 14209, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc145a48-e013-4b5c-b63a-415dfb411f01": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc145a48-e013-4b5c-b63a-415dfb411f01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "23a0b341-f803-406c-bb2b-92aceae4880e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "36b928a0be1a768a125aa452dba1b71fe53c7bb765d5db5192f660dfce433b94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef5bb4b4-1dde-4211-821b-d40272f4808b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "012f95a1cf558eaabceea02c88c8673eda0cd2a4f9430a9de7800041eaf7e25d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that\r\nall the doors were locked?

But then of\r\ncourse, the maid\u2019s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.\r\nGregor only needed to hear the visitor\u2019s first words of greeting and he\r\nknew who it was\u2014the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the\r\nonly one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became\r\nhighly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,\r\nevery one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful\r\nand devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\r\ncouldn\u2019t get out of bed if he didn\u2019t spend at least a couple of hours\r\nin the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one\r\nof the trainees make enquiries\u2014assuming enquiries were even\r\nnecessary\u2014did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have\r\nto show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that\r\nonly the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate\r\nit? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any\r\nproper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.\r\nThere was a loud thump, but it wasn\u2019t really a loud noise. His fall was\r\nsoftened a little by the carpet, and Gregor\u2019s back was also more\r\nelastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too\r\nnoticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit\r\nit as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against\r\nthe carpet.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething\u2019s fallen down in there\u201d, said the chief clerk in the room on\r\nthe left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that\r\nhad happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you\r\nhad to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this\r\nquestion, the chief clerk\u2019s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots\r\ncould now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,\r\nGregor\u2019s sister whispered to him to let him know: \u201cGregor, the chief\r\nclerk is here.\u201d \u201cYes, I know\u201d, said Gregor to himself; but without\r\ndaring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.\r\n\r\n\u201cGregor\u201d, said his father now from the room to his left, \u201cthe chief\r\nclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn\u2019t leave on the\r\nearly train. We don\u2019t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to\r\nspeak to you personally. So please open up this door. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be\r\ngood enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.\u201d Then the chief\r\nclerk called \u201cGood morning, Mr. Samsa\u201d. \u201cHe isn\u2019t well\u201d, said his\r\nmother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through\r\nthe door. \u201cHe isn\u2019t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have\r\nmissed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business.

Why else would Gregor have\r\nmissed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly\r\nmakes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he\u2019s been in\r\ntown for a week now but stayed home every evening.

Anyway, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here; we\r\nwouldn\u2019t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;\r\nhe\u2019s so stubborn; and I\u2019m sure he isn\u2019t well, he said this morning that\r\nhe is, but he isn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a moment\u201d, said Gregor slowly\r\nand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word\r\nof the conversation. \u201cWell I can\u2019t think of any other way of explaining\r\nit, Mrs. Samsa\u201d, said the chief clerk, \u201cI hope it\u2019s nothing serious.\r\nBut on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever\r\nbecome slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,\r\nwe simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.\u201d \u201cCan\r\nthe chief clerk come in to see you now then?\u201d, asked his father\r\nimpatiently, knocking at the door again. \u201cNo\u201d, said Gregor. In the room\r\non his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left\r\nhis sister began to cry.\r\n\r\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only\r\njust got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she\r\ncrying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief\r\nclerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that\r\nhappened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same\r\ndemands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that\r\nyet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of\r\nabandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the\r\ncarpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously\r\nhave expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor\r\ndiscourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later\r\non, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.\r\nAnd it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace\r\ninstead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the\r\nothers didn\u2019t know what was happening, they were worried, that would\r\nexcuse their behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice, \u201cMr. Samsa\u201d, he called to him,\r\n\u201cwhat is wrong?

Your\r\nturnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it\u2019s\r\nnot the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;\r\nbut there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.\r\nSamsa, we cannot allow there to be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Sir\u201d, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the\r\nexcitement, \u201cI\u2019ll open up immediately, just a moment. I\u2019m slightly\r\nunwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven\u2019t been able to get up. I\u2019m\r\nstill in bed now. I\u2019m quite fresh again now, though. I\u2019m just getting\r\nout of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It\u2019s not quite as easy as I\u2019d\r\nthought. I\u2019m quite alright now, though. It\u2019s shocking, what can\r\nsuddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents\r\nknow about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last\r\nnight already. They must have noticed it. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t let\r\nyou know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness\r\nwithout staying at home. Please, don\u2019t make my parents suffer! There\u2019s\r\nno basis for any of the accusations you\u2019re making; nobody\u2019s ever said a\r\nword to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven\u2019t read the latest\r\ncontracts I sent in. I\u2019ll set off with the eight o\u2019clock train, as\r\nwell, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don\u2019t need to\r\nwait, sir; I\u2019ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good\r\nas to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was\r\nsaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers\u2014this was easily\r\ndone, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed\u2014where\r\nhe now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the\r\ndoor, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief\r\nclerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn\r\nwhat they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked\r\nthen it would no longer be Gregor\u2019s responsibility and he could rest.\r\nIf, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason\r\nto be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for\r\neight o\u2019clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth\r\nchest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself\r\none last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was\r\nin serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let\r\nhimself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the\r\nedges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and\r\nkept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you understand a word of all that?\u201d the chief clerk asked his\r\nparents, \u201csurely he\u2019s not trying to make fools of us\u201d. \u201cOh, God!\u201d\r\ncalled his mother, who was already in tears, \u201che could be seriously ill\r\nand we\u2019re making him suffer.

They communicated across\r\nGregor\u2019s room. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor\r\nis ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just\r\nnow?\u201d \u201cThat was the voice of an animal\u201d, said the chief clerk, with a\r\ncalmness that was in contrast with his mother\u2019s screams. \u201cAnna! Anna!\u201d\r\nhis father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping\r\nhis hands, \u201cget a locksmith here, now!\u201d And the two girls, their skirts\r\nswishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the\r\nfront door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get\r\ndressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again;\r\nthey must have left it open; people often do in homes where something\r\nawful has happened.\r\n\r\nGregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn\u2019t\r\nunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to\r\nhim, clearer than before\u2014perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.\r\nThey had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and\r\nwere ready to help. The first response to his situation had been\r\nconfident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had\r\nbeen drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith\r\nhe expected great and surprising achievements\u2014although he did not\r\nreally distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be\r\ncrucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he\r\ncoughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even\r\nthis might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he\r\nwas no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had\r\nbecome very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the\r\ntable whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed\r\nagainst the door and listening.\r\n\r\nGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once\r\nthere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself\r\nupright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He\r\nrested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and\r\nthen set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his\r\nmouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth\u2014how was he,\r\nthen, to grasp the key?\u2014but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up\r\nfor with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start\r\nthe key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some\r\nkind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the\r\nkey and dripped onto the floor. \u201cListen\u201d, said the chief clerk in the\r\nnext room, \u201che\u2019s turning the key.\u201d Gregor was greatly encouraged by\r\nthis; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his\r\nmother too: \u201cWell done, Gregor\u201d, they should have cried, \u201ckeep at it,\r\nkeep hold of the lock!\u201d And with the idea that they were all excitedly\r\nfollowing his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying\r\nno attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned\r\nround he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright\r\nwith his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the\r\nwhole weight of his body as needed.

The clear sound of the lock as it\r\nsnapped back was Gregor\u2019s sign that he could break his concentration,\r\nand as he regained his breath he said to himself: \u201cSo, I didn\u2019t need\r\nthe locksmith after all\u201d. Then he lay his head on the handle of the\r\ndoor to open it completely.\r\n\r\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open\r\nbefore he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one\r\nof the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not\r\nwant to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still\r\noccupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to\r\nanything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud \u201cOh!\u201d,\r\nwhich sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him\u2014he was\r\nthe nearest to the door\u2014his hand pressed against his open mouth and\r\nslowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.\r\nGregor\u2019s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief\r\nclerk\u2019s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms,\r\ntook two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into\r\nher skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head\r\ndisappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and\r\nclenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.\r\nThen he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with\r\nhis hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.\r\n\r\nSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the\r\nother door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half\r\nof his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant\r\nover to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had\r\nbecome much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the\r\nother side of the street\u2014which was a hospital\u2014could be seen quite\r\nclearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its\r\nfa\u00e7ade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual\r\ndroplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from\r\nbreakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for\r\nGregor\u2019s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and\r\nhe would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of\r\ndifferent newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph\r\nof Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand\r\nand a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his\r\nuniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the\r\nfront door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and\r\nthe stairs where they began their way down below.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, then\u201d, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have\r\nkept calm, \u201cI\u2019ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and\r\nset off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see\u201d, he said to\r\nthe chief clerk, \u201cthat I\u2019m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being\r\na commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn\u2019t\r\nearn my living.

He did not keep still for a moment\r\nwhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without\r\ntaking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been\r\nsome secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had\r\nreached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot\r\nfrom the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he\r\nstretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there,\r\nthere were some supernatural force waiting to save him.\r\n\r\nGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk\r\ngo away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into\r\nextreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very\r\nwell; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would\r\nprovide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much\r\nto worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for\r\nthe future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk\r\nhad to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the\r\nfuture of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were\r\nhere! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still\r\nlying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,\r\nsurely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the\r\nentrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was\r\nnot there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without\r\nconsidering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move\r\nabout in his present state, or that his speech still might not\u2014or\r\nprobably would not\u2014be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself\r\nthrough the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,\r\nridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but\r\nGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought\r\nsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had\r\nthat happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel\r\nalright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them;\r\nto his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even\r\nmaking the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon\r\nbelieving that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end.", "start_char_idx": 30048, "end_char_idx": 34289, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8d15600-29be-4d42-aa5c-7f0767ed6ac7": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8d15600-29be-4d42-aa5c-7f0767ed6ac7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4fd85347-e6fc-4532-bc7c-72b38718651a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "0eefeeeadb85a9fdf0988df4588b9020fc2d71dac4052f5e15293d17461f67bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "88c5f022-4410-4b8e-b4c4-3afb3a626921", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9164e3628509b07b8a37d8fb7ba3588d0962017031071fc0bdd45ca030186c27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "And without\r\nconsidering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move\r\nabout in his present state, or that his speech still might not\u2014or\r\nprobably would not\u2014be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself\r\nthrough the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,\r\nridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but\r\nGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought\r\nsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.

He held\r\nback the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there\r\non the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed,\r\nat first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up\r\nwith her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: \u201cHelp, for\r\npity\u2019s sake, Help!\u201d The way she held her head suggested she wanted to\r\nsee Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards\r\nshowed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind\r\nher with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she\r\nsat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even\r\nseeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush\r\nof coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.\r\n\r\n\u201cMother, mother\u201d, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had\r\ncompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help\r\nhimself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of\r\ncoffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and\r\ninto the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though,\r\nhad no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already\r\nreached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for\r\nthe last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of\r\nreaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt\r\ndown several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all\r\naround the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,\r\nunfortunately, to put Gregor\u2019s father into a panic as well. Until then\r\nhe had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running\r\nafter the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he\r\nran after him, Gregor\u2019s father seized the chief clerk\u2019s stick in his\r\nright hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with\r\nhis hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with\r\nhis left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping\r\nhis foot at him as he went. Gregor\u2019s appeals to his father were of no\r\nhelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly\r\nturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.\r\nAcross the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor\u2019s mother had pulled\r\nopen a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A\r\nstrong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the\r\ncurtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of\r\nthem were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor\u2019s father as\r\nhe drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor\r\nhad never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go\r\nvery slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would\r\nhave been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he\r\ntook the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there\r\nwas the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in\r\nhis father\u2019s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that\r\nhe had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable\r\nof going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as\r\npossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn\r\nhimself round.", "start_char_idx": 33442, "end_char_idx": 37612, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88c5f022-4410-4b8e-b4c4-3afb3a626921": {"__data__": {"id_": "88c5f022-4410-4b8e-b4c4-3afb3a626921", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8d15600-29be-4d42-aa5c-7f0767ed6ac7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "0c7e6a70d66e9efbecfa9fe9800ed934b6c1e64eeeb02399bae78a42ca7930bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b1dcd0a7-ce1b-4978-8e3f-94bb75999a06", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7155c229d9675f77ae9e7e6cf63408fc2cae5c8cf93c624067571280e848a95c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Nothing would stop Gregor\u2019s father as\r\nhe drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man.

He was\r\nmerely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room\r\nas quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time\r\nto get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.\r\nWhat he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards\r\nall the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to\r\nGregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not\r\na pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway\r\nwithout regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted\r\nitself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the\r\nwhite door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,\r\nsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by\r\nhimself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while\r\nthose on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then\r\nhis father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from\r\nwhere he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into\r\nhis room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all\r\nwas quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke\r\nfrom his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards\r\nanyway even if he hadn\u2019t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and\r\nfelt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps\r\nand the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully\r\nshut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone\r\npalely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but\r\ndown below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to\r\nthe door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae\u2014of which he was\r\nnow beginning to learn the value\u2014in order to see what had been\r\nhappening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully\r\nstretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the\r\nlegs had been badly injured in the events of that morning\u2014it was nearly\r\na miracle that only one of them had been\u2014and dragged along lifelessly.\r\n\r\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it\r\nactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of\r\nsomething to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened\r\nmilk with little pieces of white bread floating in it.

He was so\r\npleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been\r\nthat morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly\r\ncovering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in\r\ndisappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it\r\ndifficult to eat the food\u2014he was only able to eat if his whole body\r\nworked together as a snuffling whole\u2014but the milk did not taste at all\r\nnice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister\r\nhad certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned,\r\nalmost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into\r\nthe centre of the room.\r\n\r\nThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been\r\nlit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat\r\nwith his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor\u2019s\r\nmother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to\r\nbe heard. Gregor\u2019s sister would often write and tell him about this\r\nreading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It\r\nwas so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody\r\nin the flat. \u201cWhat a quiet life it is the family lead\u201d, said Gregor to\r\nhimself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was\r\nable to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and\r\nparents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should\r\ncome to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor\r\ndid not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,\r\ncrawling up and down the room.\r\n\r\nOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was\r\nopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on\r\nthe other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the\r\nroom but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by\r\nthe door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room\r\nin some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened\r\nno more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning\r\nwhile the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him,\r\nbut now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had\r\nclearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the\r\nkeys were in the other sides.\r\n\r\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was\r\nput out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had\r\nstayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as\r\nthey went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come\r\ninto Gregor\u2019s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time\r\nto think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.\r\nFor some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain\r\nmade him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he\r\nhad been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing\r\nother than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It\r\npressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift\r\nhis head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only\r\nregret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.\r\n\r\nHe spent the whole night there.", "start_char_idx": 40314, "end_char_idx": 44159, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e0087ed-ae76-46ac-8ae5-e6bf96a7490f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e0087ed-ae76-46ac-8ae5-e6bf96a7490f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1dcd0a7-ce1b-4978-8e3f-94bb75999a06", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "eabf26265f5e00669b5c6576eac9b55912315fc5b0b7df3b91db5680fcab3d04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f8a0fe38-638b-4924-adb7-5e25c2e7bd5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "384fc60054075ff514b80e43da6b41b09347882e836cae926c0d8fa587a9caff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It was clear that no-one would come\r\ninto Gregor\u2019s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time\r\nto think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.\r\nFor some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain\r\nmade him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he\r\nhad been living in it for five years.

Some of the time he passed in a light\r\nsleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his\r\nhunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes\r\nwhich, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being\r\nhe must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest\r\nconsideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he,\r\nin his present condition, was forced to impose on them.\r\n\r\nGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions,\r\nas early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his\r\nsister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and\r\nlooked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she\r\ndid notice him under the couch\u2014he had to be somewhere, for God\u2019s sake,\r\nhe couldn\u2019t have flown away\u2014she was so shocked that she lost control of\r\nherself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to\r\nregret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and\r\ncame in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or\r\neven of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the\r\nedge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left\r\nthe milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and\r\nbring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn\u2019t do\r\nit herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,\r\nalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the\r\ncouch, throw himself at his sister\u2019s feet and beg her for something\r\ngood to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and\r\nlooked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some\r\nsurprise. She immediately picked it up\u2014using a rag, not her bare\r\nhands\u2014and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she\r\nwould bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he\r\nnever could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did\r\nbring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of\r\nthings, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten\r\nvegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that\r\nhad gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\r\ndeclared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread\r\nwith butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water\r\ninto the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for\r\nGregor\u2019s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for\r\nGregor\u2019s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,\r\nshe hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that\r\nGregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he\r\nliked. Gregor\u2019s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What\u2019s more,\r\nhis injuries must already have completely healed as he found no\r\ndifficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he\r\nhad cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger\r\nhad still hurt the day before yesterday. \u201cAm I less sensitive than I\r\nused to be, then?\u201d, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the\r\ncheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much\r\nmore than the other foods on the newspaper.", "start_char_idx": 43458, "end_char_idx": 47466, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8a0fe38-638b-4924-adb7-5e25c2e7bd5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8a0fe38-638b-4924-adb7-5e25c2e7bd5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e0087ed-ae76-46ac-8ae5-e6bf96a7490f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "55c6d35163b70aa504ce6acff60150e063eb39a29749253974dc2d18b8c9bc39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "550167e2-eb25-4c51-9662-bba01f5fb24a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "719e0b81a3208206be0c69d0183e7acd24e0c7fbb900814604939c4f6c85fe9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Then, out of consideration for\r\nGregor\u2019s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,\r\nshe hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that\r\nGregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he\r\nliked.

Quickly one after another,\r\nhis eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables\r\nand the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn\u2019t like at\r\nall, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away\r\nfrom them because he couldn\u2019t stand the smell. Long after he had\r\nfinished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly\r\nturned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He\r\nwas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he\r\nhurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay\r\nthere even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as\r\neating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could\r\nhardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with\r\nbulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up\r\nthe left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at\r\nall as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all\r\ninto a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.\r\nShe had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under\r\nthe couch and stretched himself.\r\n\r\nThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning\r\nwhile his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time\r\nafter everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would\r\nsleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor\u2019s sister would send\r\nthe maid away on some errand. Gregor\u2019s father and mother certainly did\r\nnot want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than\r\nthey could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being\r\ntold about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what\r\ndistress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor\r\nand the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As\r\nnobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that\r\nhe could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister\u2019s\r\nsighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was\r\nonly later, when she had become a little more used to everything\u2014there\r\nwas, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the\r\nsituation\u2014that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at\r\nleast a comment that could be construed as friendly. \u201cHe\u2019s enjoyed his\r\ndinner today\u201d, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all\r\nthe food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became\r\nmore and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, \u201cnow everything\u2019s\r\njust been left there again\u201d.\r\n\r\nAlthough Gregor wasn\u2019t able to hear any news directly he did listen to\r\nmuch of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone\r\nspeaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his\r\nwhole body against it.

And on the very first day the maid had\r\nfallen to her knees and begged Gregor\u2019s mother to let her go without\r\ndelay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but\r\nshe left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor\u2019s\r\nmother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.\r\nShe even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what\r\nhad happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.\r\n\r\nNow Gregor\u2019s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;\r\nalthough that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor\r\noften heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat,\r\nand receive no more answer than \u201cno thanks, I\u2019ve had enough\u201d or\r\nsomething similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would\r\nsometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the\r\nchance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing\r\nshe would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send\r\nthe housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with\r\na big, loud \u201cNo\u201d, and no more would be said.\r\n\r\nEven before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained\r\nto Gregor\u2019s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.\r\nNow and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or\r\ndocument from the little cash box he had saved from his business when\r\nit had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the\r\ncomplicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item\r\nhe wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news\r\nthat Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He\r\nhad thought that nothing at all remained from his father\u2019s business, at\r\nleast he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never\r\nasked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the\r\nfamily to a state of total despair, and Gregor\u2019s only concern at that\r\ntime had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it\r\nas quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard,\r\nwith a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a\r\ntravelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance\r\nto earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at\r\nwork straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the\r\nbenefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good\r\ntimes and they had never come again, at least not with the same\r\nsplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a\r\nposition to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They\r\nhad even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the\r\nmoney with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was\r\nno longer much warm affection given in return.

From these repeated explanations Gregor\r\nlearned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was\r\nstill some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it\r\nhad not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.\r\nBesides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had\r\nbeen bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so\r\nthat that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded\r\nwith enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.\r\nHe could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father\u2019s\r\ndebt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from\r\nthat job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better\r\nthe way his father had done things.\r\n\r\nThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to\r\nlive off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one\r\nor two years, no more. That\u2019s to say, it was money that should not\r\nreally be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had\r\nto be earned. His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self\r\nconfidence. During the five years that he had not been working\u2014the\r\nfirst holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success\u2014he\r\nhad put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would\r\nGregor\u2019s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered\r\nfrom asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home,\r\nevery other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the\r\nopen window. Would his sister have to go and earn money?

Or he might go to all\r\nthe effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill\r\nand, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it.\r\nHe had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing\r\nit now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as\r\nwhat he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day,\r\neven things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present\r\nview of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at\r\nall, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which\r\nwas a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could\r\nhave thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where\r\nthe grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant\r\nsister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always\r\npush it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied\r\nup the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then\r\non.\r\n\r\nIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for\r\nall that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to\r\nbear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried\r\nas far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it,\r\nand the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so,\r\nbut as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much\r\nbetter. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she\r\nentered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly\r\nclose the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the\r\nview into Gregor\u2019s room, then she would go straight to the window and\r\npull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it\r\nwas cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little\r\nwhile. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and\r\nnoise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while,\r\nknowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this\r\nordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him\r\nwith the windows closed.\r\n\r\nOne day, about a month after Gregor\u2019s transformation when his sister no\r\nlonger had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she\r\ncame into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still\r\nstaring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most\r\nhorrible. In itself, his sister\u2019s not coming into the room would have\r\nbeen no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to\r\nimmediately open the window while he was still there, but not only did\r\nshe not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her,\r\na stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite\r\nher. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,\r\nbut he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she\r\nseemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still\r\nfound his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she\r\nprobably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little\r\nbit of him that protruded from under the couch.

Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude\r\none time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how\r\nhis sister liked the new arrangement.\r\n\r\nFor the first fourteen days, Gregor\u2019s parents could not bring\r\nthemselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them\r\nsay how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even\r\nthough, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless\r\nand frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father\r\nand mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor\u2019s room\r\nwhile his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again\r\nshe would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor\r\nhad eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any\r\nslight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and\r\nvisit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first\r\npersuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and\r\napproved fully. Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which\r\nmade her call out: \u201cLet me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!\r\nCan\u2019t you understand I have to see him?\u201d, and Gregor would think to\r\nhimself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every\r\nday of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand\r\neverything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was\r\nstill just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult\u2019s\r\nappreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.\r\n\r\nGregor\u2019s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration\r\nfor his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during\r\nthe day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room\r\nto crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his\r\nfood soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain\r\nhimself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and\r\nceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was\r\nquite different from lying on the floor; he could breathe more freely;\r\nhis body had a light swing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost\r\nhappy, it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting\r\ngo of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, of\r\ncourse, he had far better control of his body than before and, even\r\nwith a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his\r\nsister noticed Gregor\u2019s new way of entertaining himself\u2014he had, after\r\nall, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about\u2014and\r\ngot it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing\r\nthe furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of drawers and\r\nthe desk. Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by\r\nherself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen\r\nyear old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she\r\ncertainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be\r\nallowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to\r\nopen the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no\r\nchoice but to choose some time when Gregor\u2019s father was not there and\r\nfetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could\r\nhear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.", "start_char_idx": 60246, "end_char_idx": 64493, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a070aef8-8f0d-4006-ab8e-d5fdb2201cae": {"__data__": {"id_": "a070aef8-8f0d-4006-ab8e-d5fdb2201cae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e7d06db-723c-4139-a375-5acfa45a0102", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "18ec2239877c29f3b3b2678eeb3b54ddce54bc2b02d52a82c30bd962d0b3df3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "465cdd96-f907-47bc-9d48-43eede553b9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "93c790316ea54c59cf429e8197cc9f26ac34accb26580872d07f609abd5183f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by\r\nherself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen\r\nyear old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she\r\ncertainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be\r\nallowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to\r\nopen the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no\r\nchoice but to choose some time when Gregor\u2019s father was not there and\r\nfetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could\r\nhear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.\r\nFirst, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that\r\neverything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her\r\nmother enter. Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the\r\ncouch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if\r\nit had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this\r\ntime, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to\r\nsee his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. \u201cYou\r\ncan come in, he can\u2019t be seen\u201d, said his sister, obviously leading her\r\nin by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of\r\nfeeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it\r\nfrom its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the\r\nwork for herself and ignoring her mother\u2019s warnings that she would\r\nstrain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for\r\nfifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the\r\nchest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the\r\njob finished before Gregor\u2019s father got home and leaving it in the\r\nmiddle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another\r\nthing it wasn\u2019t even sure that taking the furniture away would really\r\nbe any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the\r\nbare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn\u2019t Gregor\r\nfeel the same way about it, he\u2019d been used to this furniture in his\r\nroom for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an\r\nempty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting\r\nGregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone\r\nof her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her\r\nwords, she added \u201cand by taking the furniture away, won\u2019t it seem like\r\nwe\u2019re showing that we\u2019ve given up all hope of improvement and we\u2019re\r\nabandoning him to cope for himself? I think it\u2019d be best to leave the\r\nroom exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us\r\nagain he\u2019ll find everything unchanged and he\u2019ll be able to forget the\r\ntime in between all the easier\u201d.\r\n\r\nHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack\r\nof any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led\r\nby the family during these two months, must have made him confused\u2014he\r\ncould think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had\r\nseriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to\r\ntransform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice\r\nfurniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around\r\nunimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quickly\r\nforget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to\r\nforgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for\r\nso long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed;\r\neverything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the\r\nfurniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult\r\nfor him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the\r\nidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor\u2019s spokesman to his\r\nparents about the things that concerned him.

It was\r\nmore than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence\r\nshe had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed\r\nthat Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the\r\nfurniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all.\r\nGirls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel\r\nthey must get their way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what\r\ntempted Grete to make Gregor\u2019s situation seem even more shocking than\r\nit was so that she could do even more for him. Grete would probably be\r\nthe only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling\r\nabout the bare walls by himself.\r\n\r\nSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor\u2019s mother already\r\nlooked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped\r\nGregor\u2019s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she\r\nhad. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if\r\nhe had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women\r\npushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor\r\npoked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about\r\nit. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but,\r\nunfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the\r\nnext room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it from\r\nside to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His\r\nmother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill,\r\nso Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his\r\nstartlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front\r\nfrom moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother\u2019s attention.\r\nShe stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out\r\nto Grete.\r\n\r\nGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was\r\nhappening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all,\r\nbut he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little\r\ncalls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all\r\nthese things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.\r\nWith his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to\r\nthe floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand\r\nall of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away\r\neverything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest\r\ncontaining his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove\r\nthe writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk\r\nwhere he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school,\r\neven while he had been at infant school\u2014he really could not wait any\r\nlonger to see whether the two women\u2019s intentions were good. He had\r\nnearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to\r\nsay anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as\r\nthey stepped heavily on the floor.\r\n\r\nSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room\r\ncatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not\r\nknowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly\r\ncaught by the picture on the wall\u2014which was already denuded of\r\neverything else that had been on it\u2014of the lady dressed in copious fur.\r\nHe hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass,\r\nit held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly.", "start_char_idx": 67236, "end_char_idx": 71476, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3171e12-16db-4f12-9605-a010a786c1e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3171e12-16db-4f12-9605-a010a786c1e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "465cdd96-f907-47bc-9d48-43eede553b9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "295af45b13ef04862602fafe4d86f85ec1d4e307fbd5a6434e4d4502df8d10a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6a276f2-30c7-46fb-8f99-f4265484d417", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "276ee33a5a1becc144b61eb1d2530b2df2091070cfe91c75d0524d363ae3686e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He had\r\nnearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to\r\nsay anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as\r\nthey stepped heavily on the floor.\r\n\r\nSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room\r\ncatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not\r\nknowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly\r\ncaught by the picture on the wall\u2014which was already denuded of\r\neverything else that had been on it\u2014of the lady dressed in copious fur.\r\nHe hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass,\r\nit held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at\r\nleast, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by\r\nno-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so\r\nthat he could watch the women when they came back.\r\n\r\nThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon;\r\nGrete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.\r\n\u201cWhat shall we take now, then?\u201d, said Grete and looked around. Her eyes\r\nmet those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was\r\nthere, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not\r\nlook round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice:\r\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go back in the living room for a while?\u201d Gregor could\r\nsee what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere\r\nsafe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly\r\ntry it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at\r\nGrete\u2019s face.\r\n\r\nBut Grete\u2019s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one\r\nside, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the\r\nwallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw\r\nscreamed: \u201cOh God, oh God!\u201d Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch\r\nas if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. \u201cGregor!\u201d\r\nshouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the\r\nfirst word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She\r\nran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring\r\nher mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too\u2014he could save\r\nhis picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull\r\nhimself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he\r\ncould advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand\r\nbehind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he\r\nstartled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and\r\nbroke; a splinter cut Gregor\u2019s face, some kind of caustic medicine\r\nsplashed all over him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took\r\nhold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother;\r\nshe slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out\r\nfrom his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could\r\nnot open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she\r\nhad to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait;\r\nand, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,\r\nhe crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in\r\nhis confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down\r\ninto the middle of the dinner table.\r\n\r\nHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was\r\nquiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door.\r\nThe maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete\r\nwould have to go and answer it.

That meant Gregor would now have\r\nto try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain\r\nthings to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of\r\nhis room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he\r\ncame in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best\r\nintentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would\r\nnot be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the\r\ndoor and he would disappear.\r\n\r\nHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that;\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and\r\nglad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and\r\nlifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the\r\nway he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about,\r\nhe had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the\r\nflat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected\r\nthings to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?\r\nThe same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when\r\nGregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting\r\nin the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who\r\nwas hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would\r\njust raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they\r\nwent for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up\r\ntightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always\r\nlabour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already\r\nwalking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully\r\nand, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his\r\ncompanions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed\r\nin a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the\r\nemployees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar of the\r\ncoat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his\r\npiercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt\r\nwhite hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his\r\ncap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in\r\nan arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his\r\ntrouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and,\r\nwith look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not\r\neven know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet\r\nunusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of\r\nhis boots, but wasted no time with that\u2014he knew full well, right from\r\nthe first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to\r\nalways be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father,\r\nstopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved,\r\neven slightly. In this way they went round the room several times\r\nwithout anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression\r\nof a chase as everything went so slowly.

He became noticeably short of breath,\r\neven in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as\r\nhe lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for\r\nrunning he could hardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too\r\nslow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running;\r\nhe almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although,\r\nhere, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of\r\nnotches and protrusions\u2014then, right beside him, lightly tossed,\r\nsomething flew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then\r\nanother one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was\r\nno longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard\r\nhim. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the\r\nsideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw\r\none apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the\r\nfloor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An\r\napple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor\u2019s back and slid\r\noff without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following\r\nit, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself\r\naway, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by\r\nchanging his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread\r\nhimself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the\r\ndoor of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his\r\nmother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken\r\noff some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her\r\nto breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding\r\none after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushed\r\nherself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him\r\ntotally\u2014now Gregor lost his ability to see anything\u2014her hands behind\r\nhis father\u2019s head begging him to spare Gregor\u2019s life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor\u2019s flesh, so it\r\nremained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it\r\nthere for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to\r\nremind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and\r\nrevolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an\r\nenemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any\r\nrevulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\r\n\r\nBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility\u2014probably\r\npermanently.

He got into the habit of\r\nclosely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then,\r\nlying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the\r\nliving room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table\r\nand listen to their conversation\u2014with everyone\u2019s permission, in a way,\r\nand thus quite differently from before.\r\n\r\nThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of\r\ncourse, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he\r\nwas tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room.

All\r\nof them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father\r\nwould go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each\r\nother to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew\r\nfancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales\r\njob, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be\r\nable to get a better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake\r\nup and say to Gregor\u2019s mother \u201cyou\u2019re doing so much sewing again\r\ntoday!\u201d, as if he did not know that he had been dozing\u2014and then he\r\nwould go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a\r\ntired grin.\r\n\r\nWith a kind of stubbornness, Gregor\u2019s father refused to take his\r\nuniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg\r\nGregor\u2019s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always\r\nready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even\r\nhere. The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of\r\nthis it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor\u2019s\r\nmother and sister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole\r\nevening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons\r\nalways kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep,\r\nhighly uncomfortable but peaceful.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it struck ten, Gregor\u2019s mother would speak gently to his\r\nfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn\u2019t\r\nsleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he\r\nwas to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he\r\nhad become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at\r\nthe table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder\r\nthan ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then,\r\nhowever much mother and sister would importune him with little\r\nreproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a\r\nquarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.\r\nGregor\u2019s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his\r\near, Gregor\u2019s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but\r\nnothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into\r\nhis chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would\r\nabruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: \u201cWhat\r\na life! This is what peace I get in my old age!\u201d And supported by the\r\ntwo women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the\r\ngreatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them\r\noff and carry on by himself while Gregor\u2019s mother would throw down her\r\nneedle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father\r\nand continue being of help to him.\r\n\r\nWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give\r\nmore attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary?

After they had\r\ncome back from taking his father to bed Gregor\u2019s mother and sister\r\nwould now leave their work where it was and sit close together, cheek\r\nto cheek; his mother would point to Gregor\u2019s room and say \u201cClose that\r\ndoor, Grete\u201d, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit\r\nin the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit\r\nthere staring dry-eyed at the table.\r\n\r\nGregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would\r\nthink of taking over the family\u2019s affairs, just like before, the next\r\ntime the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the\r\nchief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen\r\nand the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from\r\nother businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a\r\ntender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat\r\nshop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow,\u2014all of them\r\nappeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had\r\nforgotten, but instead of helping him and his family they were all of\r\nthem inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared. Other times\r\nhe was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled\r\nwith simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although\r\nhe could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he\r\ncould get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was\r\nentitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor\u2019s sister no longer\r\nthought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some\r\nfood or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work\r\nin the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it\r\naway again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten\r\nor\u2014more often than not\u2014had been left totally untouched. She still\r\ncleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any\r\nquicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there\r\nwere little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of\r\nthe worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her,\r\nbut he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing\r\nanything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she\r\nhad simply decided to leave him to it.

At the same time she became\r\ntouchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the\r\nfamily understood\u2014cleaning up Gregor\u2019s room was for her and her alone.\r\nGregor\u2019s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use\r\nseveral bucketfuls of water to do it\u2014although that much dampness also\r\nmade Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But\r\nhis mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as\r\nhardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the\r\nchange in Gregor\u2019s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living\r\nroom where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke\r\ninto convulsive tears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his\r\nchair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless; then they,\r\ntoo, became agitated; Gregor\u2019s father, standing to the right of his\r\nmother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor\u2019s room to his\r\nsister; from her left, Gregor\u2019s sister screamed at her that she was\r\nnever to clean Gregor\u2019s room again; while his mother tried to draw his\r\nfather, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his\r\nsister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists;\r\nand Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the\r\ndoor to save him the sight of this and all its noise.\r\n\r\nGregor\u2019s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after\r\nGregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so\r\nhis mother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the\r\nother hand, ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was\r\nhere. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her\r\nable to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn\u2019t really\r\nrepelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real\r\ncuriosity, she opened the door to Gregor\u2019s room and found herself face\r\nto face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing\r\nhim but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in\r\namazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she\r\nnever failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and\r\nlook briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so\r\nwith words that she probably considered friendly, such as \u201ccome on\r\nthen, you old dung-beetle!\u201d, or \u201clook at the old dung-beetle there!\u201d\r\nGregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just\r\nremained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been\r\nopened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every\r\nday instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt\r\nlike it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\r\nwindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to\r\nspeak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that\r\nhe started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like\r\na kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up\r\none of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth\r\nopen, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her\r\nhand had been slammed down into Gregor\u2019s back. \u201cAren\u2019t you coming any\r\ncloser, then?\u201d, she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she\r\ncalmly put the chair back in the corner.\r\n\r\nGregor had almost entirely stopped eating.", "start_char_idx": 88269, "end_char_idx": 92169, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d471879-f463-4f95-b45c-107791c69482": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d471879-f463-4f95-b45c-107791c69482", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4342aa54-8c27-4cd9-9e27-fae02d244e11", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "542e52e59ce821367eb63e165e8ba625e06e552dfd3f200df3f456998aabbad7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e86ea6e-4e2e-4885-86d5-c8c585d280b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ea3c0d4a941f0fb6f13dc259c16024aa1e83a57c012d08bada5167e8aa67f5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\r\nwindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to\r\nspeak to him in that way once again.

Only if he happened to find\r\nhimself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take\r\nsome of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours\r\nand then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought\r\nit was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but\r\nhe had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the\r\nhabit of putting things into this room that they had no room for\r\nanywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms\r\nin the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest\r\ngentlemen\u2014all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering\r\nthrough the crack in the door one day\u2014were painfully insistent on\r\nthings\u2019 being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since\r\nthey had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and\r\nespecially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could\r\nnot tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought\r\nmost of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For this reason,\r\nmany things had become superfluous which, although they could not be\r\nsold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their\r\nway into Gregor\u2019s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way\r\nin there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she\r\ncouldn\u2019t use for the time being she would just chuck in there. He,\r\nfortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand\r\nthat held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out\r\nagain when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out\r\nin one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where\r\nthey landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way\r\nthrough the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it\r\nbecause, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was\r\nforced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in\r\nthat way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile\r\nfor hours afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening\r\nmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the\r\ndoor to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor\r\nfound it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often\r\nfailed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family\r\nhaving noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time,\r\nthough, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open,\r\nand it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in\r\nthe evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the table where,\r\nformerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they\r\nunfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor\u2019s\r\nmother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon\r\nbehind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The\r\nfood was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen\r\nbent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the\r\nfood before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to\r\ncount as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of\r\nmeat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish\r\nwhether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to\r\nthe kitchen.", "start_char_idx": 91456, "end_char_idx": 95618, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e86ea6e-4e2e-4885-86d5-c8c585d280b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e86ea6e-4e2e-4885-86d5-c8c585d280b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d471879-f463-4f95-b45c-107791c69482", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "1502289e0d448cd346e32b31d1aa8ec6ec935701ab981d729763274fa29bd5d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "facace98-1c28-4090-97c3-2ea7e30cf520", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "019f313243ec01e1eb6916e29014e5c76a9b37c179053f903a3f6b3da6d799e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They sat up at the table where,\r\nformerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they\r\nunfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks.

It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor\u2019s mother and\r\nsister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nThe family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor\u2019s father\r\ncame into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once\r\nwith his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen\r\nstood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they\r\nwere alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to\r\nGregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth\r\ncould still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you\r\nneed teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything\r\nwith jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. \u201cI\u2019d like to\r\neat something\u201d, said Gregor anxiously, \u201cbut not anything like they\u2019re\r\neating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!\u201d\r\n\r\nThroughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the\r\nviolin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the\r\nkitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one\r\nin the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the\r\nothers, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and\r\nsmoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up\r\nand went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood\r\npressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the\r\nkitchen, as Gregor\u2019s father called out: \u201cIs the playing perhaps\r\nunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.\u201d \u201cOn the\r\ncontrary\u201d, said the middle gentleman, \u201cwould the young lady not like to\r\ncome in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much\r\nmore cosy and comfortable?\u201d \u201cOh yes, we\u2019d love to\u201d, called back\r\nGregor\u2019s father as if he had been the violin player himself. The\r\ngentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor\u2019s father soon\r\nappeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister\r\nwith the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin\r\nplaying; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and\r\ntherefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen,\r\ndid not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against\r\nthe door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his\r\nuniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the\r\ngentlemen and sat\u2014leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to\r\nhave placed it\u2014out of the way in a corner.\r\n\r\nHis sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one\r\non each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing,\r\nGregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in\r\nthe living room.

Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he\r\nwas but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless\r\nabout the others. What\u2019s more, there was now all the more reason to\r\nkeep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere\r\nin his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried threads,\r\nhairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too\r\nindifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on\r\nthe carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this\r\ncondition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the\r\nimmaculate floor of the living room.\r\n\r\nNo-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the\r\nviolin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in\r\ntheir pockets and come up far too close behind the music stand to look\r\nat all the notes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor\u2019s\r\nsister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to\r\nthe window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half\r\nvolume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor\u2019s father observed\r\nthem anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had\r\nexpected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had\r\nbeen disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance\r\nand it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to\r\nbe disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the\r\nsmoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet\r\nGregor\u2019s sister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one\r\nside, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy\r\nexpression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head\r\nclose to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.\r\nWas he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that\r\nhe was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been\r\nyearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister\r\nand tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her\r\nviolin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He\r\nnever wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway;\r\nhis shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he\r\nwanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the\r\nattackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though,\r\nbut stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch\r\nwith her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always\r\nintended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told\r\neveryone about it last Christmas\u2014had Christmas really come and gone\r\nalready?\u2014if this misfortune hadn\u2019t got in the way, and refuse to let\r\nanyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would\r\nbreak out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her\r\nshoulder and kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to\r\nwork, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Samsa!\u201d, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor\u2019s father,\r\npointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor\r\nas he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the\r\nthree gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and\r\nthen looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more\r\nimportant to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even\r\nthough they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more\r\nentertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them\r\nwith his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their\r\nroom at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his\r\nbody.

They asked Gregor\u2019s father for explanations, raised\r\ntheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back\r\ntowards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor\u2019s sister had\r\novercome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly\r\ninterrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang\r\nlimply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still\r\nplaying, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the\r\ninstrument on her mother\u2019s lap who still sat laboriously struggling for\r\nbreath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure\r\nfrom her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.\r\nUnder his sister\u2019s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds\r\nflew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the\r\nbeds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the\r\nroom. Gregor\u2019s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he\r\nforgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and\r\npressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the\r\nmiddle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot\r\nand thereby brought Gregor\u2019s father to a halt. \u201cI declare here and\r\nnow\u201d, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor\u2019s mother and\r\nsister to gain their attention too, \u201cthat with regard to the repugnant\r\nconditions that prevail in this flat and with this family\u201d\u2014here he\r\nlooked briefly but decisively at the floor\u2014\u201cI give immediate notice on\r\nmy room. For the days that I have been living here I will, of course,\r\npay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed\r\nwith some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would\r\nbe very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.\u201d He was silent\r\nand looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his\r\ntwo friends joined in with the words: \u201cAnd we also give immediate\r\nnotice.\u201d With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nGregor\u2019s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his\r\nhands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out\r\nfor his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept\r\nnodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout\r\nall this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first\r\nseen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps\r\nalso because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to\r\nmove. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he\r\nwaited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on\r\nhis mother\u2019s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cFather, Mother\u201d, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as\r\nintroduction, \u201cwe can\u2019t carry on like this.

We\r\ncan\u2019t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured\r\nlike this, we can\u2019t endure it.

But as it is ...\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to go\u201d, shouted his sister, \u201cthat\u2019s the only way, Father.\r\nYou\u2019ve got to get rid of the idea that that\u2019s Gregor. We\u2019ve only harmed\r\nourselves by believing it for so long. How can that be Gregor? If it\r\nwere Gregor he would have seen long ago that it\u2019s not possible for\r\nhuman beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of\r\nhis own free will. We wouldn\u2019t have a brother any more, then, but we\r\ncould carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As it is\r\nthis animal is persecuting us, it\u2019s driven out our tenants, it\r\nobviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on\r\nthe streets. Father, look, just look\u201d, she suddenly screamed, \u201che\u2019s\r\nstarting again!\u201d In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor\u2019s\r\ncomprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed\r\nherself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her\r\nown mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind\r\nher father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up\r\nhalf raising his hands in front of Gregor\u2019s sister as if to protect\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his\r\nsister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go\r\nback into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his\r\npain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal\r\nof effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly\r\nraising it and striking it against the floor. He stopped and looked\r\nround. They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only\r\nbeen alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.\r\nHis mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed\r\nagainst each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister\r\nsat next to his father with her arms around his neck.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe now they\u2019ll let me turn round\u201d, thought Gregor and went back to\r\nwork.

Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.\r\nHis mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed\r\nagainst each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister\r\nsat next to his father with her arms around his neck.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe now they\u2019ll let me turn round\u201d, thought Gregor and went back to\r\nwork. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had\r\nsometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more,\r\neverything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished\r\nturning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the\r\ngreat distance that separated him from his room, and could not\r\nunderstand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little\r\nwhile before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on\r\ncrawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a\r\nword, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his\r\nhead until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way\r\nround as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough\r\nto see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood\r\nup. With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen\r\ncompletely asleep.\r\n\r\nHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,\r\nbolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that\r\nhis little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in\r\nso much of a rush. She had been standing there waiting and sprung\r\nforward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she\r\nturned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents \u201cAt last!\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat now, then?\u201d, Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the\r\ndarkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at\r\nall. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to\r\nactually move around on those spindly little legs until then was\r\nunnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his\r\nentire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker\r\nand weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already\r\nhardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around\r\nit, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought back of his\r\nfamily with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that he must\r\ngo away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state\r\nof empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike\r\nthree in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light\r\neverywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his\r\nhead sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his\r\nnostrils.\r\n\r\nWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning\u2014they\u2019d often asked her\r\nnot to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry\r\nshe still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she\u2019d arrived and\r\nfrom then on it was impossible to sleep in peace\u2014she made her usual\r\nbrief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought\r\nhe was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she\r\nattributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be\r\nholding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with\r\nit from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to\r\nmake a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she\r\nfound she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all\r\ndid she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really\r\nhappened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste\r\ntime to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness\r\nof the bedrooms: \u201cCome and \u2019ave a look at this, it\u2019s dead, just lying\r\nthere, stone dead!\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to\r\nmake an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they\r\ncould grasp what she was saying.

But then, each from his own side, they\r\nhurried out of bed. Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders,\r\nMrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went\r\ninto Gregor\u2019s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room\r\nwhere Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in;\r\nshe was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness\r\nof her face seemed to confirm this. \u201cDead?\u201d, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking\r\nat the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for\r\nherself and could have known it even without checking. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\r\nsaid\u201d, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor\u2019s body\r\nanother shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.\r\nMrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but\r\ndid not complete it. \u201cNow then\u201d, said Mr. Samsa, \u201clet\u2019s give thanks to\r\nGod for that\u201d. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his\r\nexample. Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: \u201cJust\r\nlook how thin he was. He didn\u2019t eat anything for so long. The food came\r\nout again just the same as when it went in\u201d. Gregor\u2019s body was indeed\r\ncompletely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now\r\nhe was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make\r\nthem look away.\r\n\r\n\u201cGrete, come with us in here for a little while\u201d, said Mrs. Samsa with\r\na pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not\r\nwithout looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened\r\nthe window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh\r\nair had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of\r\nMarch, after all.\r\n\r\nThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in\r\namazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. \u201cWhere\r\nis our breakfast?\u201d, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.\r\nShe just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to\r\nthe men that they might like to come into Gregor\u2019s room. They did so,\r\nand stood around Gregor\u2019s corpse with their hands in the pockets of\r\ntheir well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room.\r\n\r\nThen the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his\r\nuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of\r\nthem had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her face\r\nagainst her father\u2019s arm.\r\n\r\n\u201cLeave my home. Now!\u201d, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without\r\nletting the women from him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d, asked the middle of\r\nthe three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The\r\nother two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed\r\nthem together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could\r\nonly end in their favour. \u201cI mean just what I said\u201d, answered Mr.\r\nSamsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards\r\nthe man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if\r\nthe contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new\r\npositions. \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll go then\u201d, he said, and looked up at Mr.\r\nSamsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted\r\npermission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision.

Mr. Samsa merely\r\nopened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that,\r\nand without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the\r\nfront hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some\r\ntime before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they\r\njumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr.\r\nSamsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the\r\nconnection with their leader. Once there, all three took their hats\r\nfrom the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word\r\nand left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out\r\nonto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men\u2019s\r\nintentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three\r\ngentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they\r\nturned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a\r\nfew moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa\r\nfamily lost interest in them; when a butcher\u2019s boy, proud of posture\r\nwith his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer\r\nthan they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and\r\nwent, as if relieved, back into the flat.\r\n\r\nThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation\r\nand to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but\r\nthey were in serious need of it. So they sat at the table and wrote\r\nthree letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her\r\ncontractor and Grete to her principal. The cleaner came in while they\r\nwere writing to tell them she was going, she\u2019d finished her work for\r\nthat morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up\r\nfrom what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did\r\nnot seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. \u201cWell?\u201d,\r\nasked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her\r\nface as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only\r\ndo it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich\r\nfeather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa\r\nall the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all\r\ndirections. \u201cWhat is it you want then?\u201d, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the\r\ncleaner had the most respect for. \u201cYes\u201d, she answered, and broke into a\r\nfriendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, \u201cwell then,\r\nthat thing in there, you needn\u2019t worry about how you\u2019re going to get\r\nrid of it. That\u2019s all been sorted out.\u201d Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down\r\nover their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were\r\nwriting; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing\r\neverything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite\r\nclear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them\r\nall about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and,\r\nclearly peeved, called out \u201cCheerio then, everyone\u201d, turned round\r\nsharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.\r\n\r\n\u201cTonight she gets sacked\u201d, said Mr.", "start_char_idx": 115297, "end_char_idx": 119197, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6be17277-6500-4b91-bd32-47b2d826ff93": {"__data__": {"id_": "6be17277-6500-4b91-bd32-47b2d826ff93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75f309c1-6fd8-48e0-b43b-b8639122f75b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ce802e3aa4e88cec8000ff8ab861139030b671cb013a1345895b696f09522b9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7af4d25-6bf8-486a-90e9-d8a8ece49d70", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_name": "kafka_metamorphosis.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 122666, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "4a2fa34292d13d3738e9283d7fca583c547bde24ccdb648f31dc18b98df1e77f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u201cYes\u201d, she answered, and broke into a\r\nfriendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, \u201cwell then,\r\nthat thing in there, you needn\u2019t worry about how you\u2019re going to get\r\nrid of it.

They had the tram, filled with warm\r\nsunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats,\r\nthey discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination\r\nthey were not at all bad\u2014until then they had never asked each other\r\nabout their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held\r\nparticularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for\r\nthe time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving\r\nhouse; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper\r\nthan the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a\r\nbetter location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete\r\nwas becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late\r\nher cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nSamsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their\r\ndaughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.\r\nThey became quieter. Just from each other\u2019s glance and almost without\r\nknowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man\r\nfor her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good\r\nintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the\r\nfirst to get up and stretch out her young body.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK METAMORPHOSIS ***", "start_char_idx": 118438, "end_char_idx": 121319, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4067198d-c541-47f4-ac33-78a60938f5a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "4067198d-c541-47f4-ac33-78a60938f5a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "929b423c-31bc-4e56-a6fa-b6e5360ce809", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "579a015e00785ef2f6c475d2a3b00c48c916d9331587e4737badfea0028f4e92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "52c2d6fe-0d8e-43fd-a662-ac3313f38bbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "385569b09072ef6417168a265570a74d83f193a1e01c168e2038ad68f0ba5275", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "What I Worked On\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\n\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines \u2014 CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader \u2014 sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\n\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\n\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.\n\nWith microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping. [1]\n\nThe first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself. It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.\n\nComputers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.\n\nThough I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.\n\nAI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world.", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 4172, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52c2d6fe-0d8e-43fd-a662-ac3313f38bbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "52c2d6fe-0d8e-43fd-a662-ac3313f38bbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "929b423c-31bc-4e56-a6fa-b6e5360ce809", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "579a015e00785ef2f6c475d2a3b00c48c916d9331587e4737badfea0028f4e92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4067198d-c541-47f4-ac33-78a60938f5a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "e242e7bfd677993dad25cf242f5ad3ec50f8a7ad794a6d0276365bf4aabca377", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "397c7380-c2a1-46a4-b724-95924084f956", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ecee3b7a8a2eae68259f41051278942c6ec2233240b8050b5d32c62103b7e044", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\n\nI couldn't have put this into words when I was 18.

I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.\n\nThere weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll. I knew what I was going to do.\n\nFor my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code, but what made it even more exciting was my belief \u2014 hard to imagine now, but not unique in 1985 \u2014 that it was already climbing the lower slopes of intelligence.\n\nI had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn't make you choose a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose \"Artificial Intelligence.\" When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.\n\nI applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which I'd visited because Rich Draves went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who'd invented the type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me, so that was where I went.\n\nI don't remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the sort of AI in which a program that's told \"the dog is sitting on the chair\" translates this into some formal representation and adds it to the list of things it knows.\n\nWhat these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.\n\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.", "start_char_idx": 3459, "end_char_idx": 7784, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "397c7380-c2a1-46a4-b724-95924084f956": {"__data__": {"id_": "397c7380-c2a1-46a4-b724-95924084f956", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "929b423c-31bc-4e56-a6fa-b6e5360ce809", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "579a015e00785ef2f6c475d2a3b00c48c916d9331587e4737badfea0028f4e92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "52c2d6fe-0d8e-43fd-a662-ac3313f38bbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "678229cc001105a11b11a5afe5bc24feab9eca082e6fb2f67f7db8316fc31bed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c781b7bb-fa0f-4b9b-a088-079308bebad7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "59f3bfeece03bebef255dfaa3b8a2605a508a94c506392e3df1252b9414a487e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.\n\nSo I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp.

But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.\n\nComputer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for theory \u2014 indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable of the two halves \u2014 but building things seemed so much more exciting.\n\nThe problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.\n\nThere were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could have one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so off they went. That was what happened to systems work.\n\nI wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would last.\n\nIn this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.\n\nAnd moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get research funding.\n\nI had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had no idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually that people made art \u2014 that it didn't just appear spontaneously \u2014 but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.\n\nThat fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham, was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I was taking, he never said anything.\n\nSo now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.\n\nI didn't see a way out of this situation. I didn't want to drop out of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he'd found such a spectacular way to get out of grad school.\n\nThen one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall.

I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so. I'll give you something to read in a few days.\"\n\nI picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There's a whole world there that's barely been explored. But all I wanted was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation sufficed, just barely.\n\nMeanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence I went.\n\nI'd applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color, and design.\n\nToward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from the Accademia, which had been delayed because they'd sent it to Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only weeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I had some money saved from consulting work I'd done in grad school; there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now all I had to do was learn Italian.\n\nOnly stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been outnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the RISD foundation that summer, but I still don't know how I managed to pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited vocabulary. [2]\n\nI'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier.

And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.\n\nOur model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer. She'd copy an obscure old painting out of a book, and then he'd take the copy and maltreat it to make it look old. [3]\n\nWhile I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense. [4]\n\nI liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or \"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.\n\nThis is not the only way to paint. I'm not 100% sure it's even a good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth trying.\n\nOur teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn't teaching me anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the end of the first year I went back to the US.\n\nI wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word? Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet. [5]\n\nInterleaf had done something pretty bold.

This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.\n\nThe good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially by art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.\n\nI learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly about what not to do. I learned that it's better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.\n\nBut the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.\n\nWhen I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big part of my life.\n\nIn the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too.

For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature style, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work. [6]\n\nThere were plenty of earnest students too: kids who \"could draw\" in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD, but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekers.\n\nI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit, and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn't much more than my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists were. So yes, I wanted it! [7]\n\nAsterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home. Now I was a New York artist \u2014 in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in New York.\n\nI was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I didn't want to have to program in another language, which in those days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp. This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this time.)\n\nThe best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early photorealists, and I'd taken her painting class at Harvard. I've never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.\n\nShe liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side. One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn't that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly occurred to me: why don't I become rich? Then I'll be able to work on whatever I want.\n\nMeanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web.

I'd seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.\n\nIf I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy ones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.\n\nThen some online stores started to appear, and I realized that except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we'd been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called an \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.\n\nSo in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write software to build online stores. At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world. But we decided we'd at least try writing a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new site generator for stores \u2014 in Lisp, of course.\n\nWe were working out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge. His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links? Then we'd never have to write anything to run on users' computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we'd serve them from. Users wouldn't need anything more than a browser.\n\nThis kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn't clear that it was even possible. To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you could build a whole store through the browser, without any client software or typing anything into the command line on the server.\n\nNow we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.

I had visions of a whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn't need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software. Now you could just update the software right on the server.\n\nWe started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding from Idelle's husband Julian. In return for that and doing the initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10% of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y Combinator's. We knew founders needed something like this, because we'd needed it ourselves.\n\nAt this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by what I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside the proper proportion of the money I'd made consulting for Interleaf? No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend, I needed that seed funding to live on.\n\nWe originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious about the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages, the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the server.\n\nIt helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking legit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his bedroom look more legit than a big company.\n\n(If you're curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it's because it's still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)\n\nIn September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers, and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker.\n\nIt was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They're the two most independent-minded people I know, and in completely different ways. If you could see inside Rtm's brain it would look like a colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor's it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.\n\nWe opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually wanted online stores. [8]\n\nThere were three main parts to the software: the editor, which people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart, which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I'd had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.\n\nThere were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s.

We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.\n\nWe did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example, we did what's now called \"doing things that don't scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we're driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly humiliating, since the whole raison d'etre of our software was that people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get users.\n\nWe learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt. The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to rescan about 30 images of men's shirts. My first set of scans were so beautiful too.\n\nThough this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing. Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled by \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way I was converted to fatherhood once I had kids. Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have so many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.\n\nAnother thing I didn't get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough, you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't hire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then you'll control your own destiny.\n\nAlas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that's what startups did during the Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company. And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the result was a mess even by startup standards.\n\nIt was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb stock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly.

Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing I owned.\n\nThe next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue combined with Yahoo's prematurely aged culture and grim cube farm in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.\n\nYahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.\n\nWhen I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.\n\nBut I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately. There was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich. Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.\n\nSo I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people in California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent control you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't know any of them.\n\nWhen I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was rich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn't been.

Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).\n\nMeanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually choose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there wasn't one. Huh.\n\nAround this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting applications for them? [9] You could run all sorts of services on the servers that these applications could use just by making an API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images, taking credit card payments, etc.\n\nI got so excited about this idea that I couldn't think about anything else. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn't particularly want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and though he'd made a lot of money the last time I'd lured him into working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink. So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly refused to work on it.\n\nHmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.\n\nBy then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an \"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long before it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.\n\nI started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two services (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the summer I realized I really didn't want to run a company \u2014 especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be.

After we started Y Combinator, I would often encounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and even trying to write some of it.\n\nThe subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.\n\nThe following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we'd used Lisp at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online, on paulgraham.com, which I'd created years before using Viaweb but had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views. What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone had posted it on Slashdot. [10]\n\nWow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish anything.\n\nThis had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there would be a whole new generation of essays. [11]\n\nIn the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been vanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties. There were so many essays that had never been written, because there had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going to write them. [12]\n\nI've worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.\n\nI knew that online essays would be a marginal medium at first. Socially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions published in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging instead of discouraging.\n\nOne of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't prestigious.

I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my web site.

Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.\n\nIt's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee you're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the most common type of wrong one.\n\nOver the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds of different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a book, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to have dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which taught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn studio), to use as an office.\n\nOne night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be people they didn't know but would probably like. One of the guests was someone I didn't know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman called Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.\n\nJessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank. This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So she decided to compile a book of interviews with startup founders.\n\nWhen the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her staff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as CEO, and so on.\n\nOne of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks. The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people and tell them something that won't waste their time is a great spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they'd be able to avoid the worst of the mistakes we'd made.\n\nSo I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders, because then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed they were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known), I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk. But afterward it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about angel investing. I'd been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now it was 7 years later and I still hadn't done one angel investment.\n\nMeanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects we could work on together.

I missed working with them, and it seemed like there had to be something we could collaborate on.\n\nAs Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged. Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We'd start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we'd been talking about. I'd fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and work for it, and we'd get Robert and Trevor as partners too. [13]\n\nOnce again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.\n\nThere are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure them all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm. In those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC firms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments. And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.\n\nYC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we funded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers, but professional investors are thinking \"Wow, that means they got all the returns.\" But once again, this was not due to any particular insight on our part. We didn't know how VC firms were organized. It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we wouldn't have known where to start. [14]\n\nThe most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where they'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out of it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.\n\nWe'd use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters. We'd all have dinner there once a week \u2014 on tuesdays, since I was already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays \u2014 and after dinner we'd bring in experts on startups to give talks.\n\nWe knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders Program, and I posted an announcement on my site, inviting undergrads to apply.", "start_char_idx": 48447, "end_char_idx": 52802, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a42d00bf-ce71-4cc6-a0fd-67e11587800a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a42d00bf-ce71-4cc6-a0fd-67e11587800a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "929b423c-31bc-4e56-a6fa-b6e5360ce809", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "579a015e00785ef2f6c475d2a3b00c48c916d9331587e4737badfea0028f4e92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b154805c-c308-41a1-a076-782b27f58921", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/renato/Documents/Repos/GenAI4Humanists/Notebooks/../Data/paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_name": "paul_graham_essay.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75042, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "6c3358582946dd82886589b813b31fec236abb8efc092183e2224edcaf6a6827", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d86b43da-2858-4eae-8eb9-930a3baeaf94", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a772becc04b244e13465cd11af4d714e8e6c6e4fb8dd5910226da7a3c5512e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Why not organize a summer program where they'd start startups instead?

I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way to get \"deal flow,\" as investors call it, but it turned out to be the perfect source. [15] We got 225 applications for the Summer Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them were from people who'd already graduated, or were about to that spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious than we'd intended.\n\nWe invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought the founders free air conditioners. [16]\n\nFairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.\n\nAs YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another, and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another's customers. We used to refer jokingly to the \"YC GDP,\" but as YC grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their batchmates.\n\nI had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew, and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was still able to work on other things.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders.

This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn't startup founders we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one's intellectual curiosity.\n\nHN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest source of stress for me. If all I'd had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40% chance it had do with everything else combined. [17]\n\nAs well as HN, I wrote all of YC's internal software in Arc. But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.\n\nYC was different from other kinds of work I've done. Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work, because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders were very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn't have picked a better way to do it.\n\nThere were parts of the job I didn't like. Disputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who maltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the parts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once said about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better work very hard.\n\nOne day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I remember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you should make sure Y Combinator isn't the last cool thing you do.\"\n\nAt the time I didn't understand what he meant, but gradually it dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange advice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.\n\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer.

The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\n\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn't, so we decided we'd try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn't be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we'd let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\n\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he'd take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\n\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\n\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I'm interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\n\nWhat should I do next? Rtm's advice hadn't included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I'd paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\n\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I'd never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I'd always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven't painted since. So far anyway.\n\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\n\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren't about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\n\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself.

If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what's the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\n\nMcCarthy didn't realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn't match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn't understand why at the time.\n\nMcCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way \u2014 indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.\n\nNow they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.\n\nI wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it's an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast, but fast enough to test.\n\nI had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an interpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.\n\nSo I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I'd ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I'd check Twitter or HN and see someone asking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"\n\nWorking on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools.

Like McCarthy's original Lisp, it's a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy's Lisp it's a spec expressed as code.\n\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I'd had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who'd lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n\n[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n\n[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n\n[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n\n[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n\n[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious.

The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n\n[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n\n[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n\n[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don't already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n\n[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n\n[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n\nWhich in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n\nHere's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n\n[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n\nI picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n\n[14] YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009, because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go back to being self-funded.\n\n[15] I've never liked the term \"deal flow,\" because it implies that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This is not only false, but it's the purpose of YC to falsify it, by causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.\n\n[16] She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes, because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could carry now.\n\n[17] Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum, you're assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every conversation involving you.

And when you write essays, people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations, because the assumption that you're present in the conversation means that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation reads as a tacit admission that it's correct. But that in turn encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses that now is their chance.\n\n[18] The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica anymore. We'd been working on YC almost the whole time we'd known each other, and we'd neither tried nor wanted to separate it from our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted tree.\n\n[19] One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs discovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy's 1960 paper.\n\nBut if so there's no reason to suppose that this is the limit of the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.\n\n\n\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel Gackle,
