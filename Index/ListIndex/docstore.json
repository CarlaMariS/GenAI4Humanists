Simple numbers in square brackets, e.g., [212], were shown\r\nthat way in the original text. Bottom-of-page footnotes, e.g., [A],\r\nwere shown as [*] in the original text, but were changed here to\r\nsequential letters. In the orignal text, a few missing letters were\r\nadded in square brackets, e.g., [W]e, and are shown that way here.\r\n\r\nOther Notes are at the end of this eBook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE PRESIDENT\u2019S COMMISSION ON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT\r\nKENNEDY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY\r\n\r\n35th President of the United States\r\n\r\nMay 29, 1917-November 22, 1963]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE WARREN\r\n  COMMISSION\r\n  REPORT\r\n\r\n\r\n  Report of President\u2019s Commission on the Assassination\r\n  of President John F.

JOHNSON, by Executive Order No. 11130 dated\r\nNovember 29, 1963,[F-1] created this Commission to investigate the\r\nassassination on November 22, 1963, of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the\r\n35th President of the United States. The President directed the\r\nCommission to evaluate all the facts and circumstances surrounding the\r\nassassination and the subsequent killing of the alleged assassin and to\r\nreport its findings and conclusions to him.[F-2]\r\n\r\nThe subject of the Commission\u2019s inquiry was a chain of events which\r\nsaddened and shocked the people of the United States and of the world.\r\nThe assassination of President Kennedy and the simultaneous wounding\r\nof John B. Connally, Jr., Governor of Texas, had been followed within\r\nan hour by the slaying of Patrolman J.\u00a0D. Tippit of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment. In the United States and abroad, these events evoked\r\nuniversal demands for an explanation.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the assassination, State and local officials in\r\nDallas devoted their resources to the apprehension of the assassin.\r\nThe U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for the protection\r\nof the President, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation began an\r\ninvestigation at the direction of President Johnson. Within 35 minutes\r\nof the killing of Patrolman Tippit, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested\r\nby the Dallas police as a suspect in that crime. Based on evidence\r\nprovided by Federal, State, and local agencies, the State of Texas\r\narraigned Oswald within 12 hours of his arrest, charging him with the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy and the murder of Patrolman Tippit.", "start_char_idx": 3165, "end_char_idx": 6676, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "611bd7a1-134d-4f40-832e-af3fce8f42dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "611bd7a1-134d-4f40-832e-af3fce8f42dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "74f01a1e-b3db-48b1-be62-2062bd4de888", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "6c3d4598a9f481c2ad4df8fd3e016d7608ed9cce072516e4cf3bb87315303eb4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc48df42-feea-4047-a39b-11cc21ba47e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "61a6f16d03ef388410bd6bd0bcd8a7c4d1fc528e951bec0bc28d16edefcb1283", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In the United States and abroad, these events evoked\r\nuniversal demands for an explanation.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the assassination, State and local officials in\r\nDallas devoted their resources to the apprehension of the assassin.\r\nThe U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for the protection\r\nof the President, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation began an\r\ninvestigation at the direction of President Johnson. Within 35 minutes\r\nof the killing of Patrolman Tippit, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested\r\nby the Dallas police as a suspect in that crime. Based on evidence\r\nprovided by Federal, State, and local agencies, the State of Texas\r\narraigned Oswald within 12 hours of his arrest, charging him with the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy and the murder of Patrolman Tippit.\r\nOn November 24, 1963, less than 48 hours after his arrest, Oswald was\r\nfatally shot in the basement of the Dallas Police Department by Jack\r\nRuby, a Dallas nightclub owner. This shooting took place in full view\r\nof a national television audience.\r\n\r\nThe events of these 2 days were witnessed with shock and disbelief\r\nby a Nation grieving the loss of its young leader. Throughout the\r\nworld, reports on these events were disseminated in massive detail.\r\nTheories and speculations mounted regarding the assassination. In many\r\ninstances, the intense public demand for facts was met by partial\r\nand frequently conflicting reports from Dallas and elsewhere. After\r\nOswald\u2019s arrest and his denial of all guilt, public attention focused\r\nboth on the extent of the evidence against him and the possibility of\r\na conspiracy, domestic or foreign. His subsequent death heightened\r\npublic interest and stimulated additional suspicions and rumors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSION AND ITS POWERS\r\n\r\nAfter Lee Harvey Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby, it was no longer\r\npossible to arrive at the complete story of the assassination through\r\nnormal judicial procedures during a trial of the alleged assassin.\r\nAlternative means for instituting a complete investigation were widely\r\ndiscussed. Federal and State officials conferred on the possibility of\r\ninitiating a court of inquiry before a State magistrate in Texas. An\r\ninvestigation by the grand jury of Dallas County also was considered.\r\nAs speculation about the existence of a foreign or domestic conspiracy\r\nbecame widespread, committees in both Houses of Congress weighed the\r\ndesirability of congressional hearings to discover all the facts\r\nrelating to the assassination.\r\n\r\nBy his order of November 29 establishing the Commission, President\r\nJohnson sought to avoid parallel investigations and to concentrate\r\nfactfinding in a body having the broadest national mandate. As Chairman\r\nof the Commission, President Johnson selected Earl Warren, Chief\r\nJustice of the United States, former Governor and attorney general of\r\nthe State of California. From the U.S. Senate, he chose Richard B.\r\nRussell, Democratic Senator from Georgia and chairman of the Senate\r\nArmed Services Committee, former Governor of, and county attorney in,\r\nthe State of Georgia, and John Sherman Cooper, Republican Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky, former county and circuit judge, State of Kentucky,\r\nand U.S. Ambassador to India. Two members of the Commission were\r\ndrawn from the U.S. House of Representatives: Hale Boggs, Democratic\r\nU.S. Representative from Louisiana and majority whip, and Gerald R.\r\nFord, Republican, U.S. Representative from Michigan and chairman of\r\nthe House Republican Conference. From private life, President Johnson\r\nselected two lawyers by profession, both of whom have served in the\r\nadministrations of Democratic and Republican Presidents: Allen W.\r\nDulles, former Director of Central Intelligence, and John J. McCloy,\r\nformer President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and\r\nDevelopment, former U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, and during\r\nWorld War II, the Assistant Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nFrom its first meeting on December 5, 1963, the Commission viewed the\r\nExecutive order as an unequivocal Presidential mandate to conduct a\r\nthorough and independent investigation. Because of the numerous rumors\r\nand theories, the Commission concluded that the public interest in\r\ninsuring that the truth was ascertained could not be met by merely\r\naccepting the reports or the analyses of Federal or State agencies.\r\nNot only were the premises and conclusions of those reports critically\r\nreassessed, but all assertions or rumors relating to a possible\r\nconspiracy, or the complicity of others than Oswald, which have come to\r\nthe attention of the Commission, were investigated.\r\n\r\nOn December 13, 1963, Congress enacted Senate Joint Resolution 137\r\n(Public Law 88-202)[F-3] empowering the Commission to issue subpoenas\r\nrequiring the testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence\r\nrelating to any matter under its investigation.", "start_char_idx": 5894, "end_char_idx": 10745, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc48df42-feea-4047-a39b-11cc21ba47e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc48df42-feea-4047-a39b-11cc21ba47e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "611bd7a1-134d-4f40-832e-af3fce8f42dc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "c42ef53059150457c04cc68e001827253dd5ed127ecb0be362349d9f813a1b65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c70ce89f-a65d-45d5-8e73-c177b40edf17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1308cc82b8bb4e2e91b3911f3d1e30a8f0adfe9b6c7601ea99ea154934ccb509", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "From its first meeting on December 5, 1963, the Commission viewed the\r\nExecutive order as an unequivocal Presidential mandate to conduct a\r\nthorough and independent investigation.

In addition, the\r\nresolution authorized the Commission to compel testimony from witnesses\r\nclaiming the privilege against self-incrimination under the fifth\r\namendment to the U.S. Constitution by providing for the grant of\r\nimmunity to persons testifying under such compulsion. Immunity under\r\nthese provisions was not granted to any witness during the Commission\u2019s\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nThe Commission took steps immediately to obtain the necessary staff\r\nto fulfill its assignment. J. Lee Rankin, former Solicitor General of\r\nthe United States, was sworn in as general counsel for the Commission\r\non December 16, 1963. Additional members of the legal staff were\r\nselected during the next few weeks. The Commission has been aided by 14\r\nassistant counsel with high professional qualifications, selected by it\r\nfrom widely separated parts of the United States. This staff undertook\r\nthe work of the Commission with a wealth of legal and investigative\r\nexperience and a total dedication to the determination of the truth.\r\nThe Commission has been assisted also by highly qualified personnel\r\nfrom several Federal agencies, assigned to the Commission at its\r\nrequest. This group included lawyers from the Department of Justice,\r\nagents of the Internal Revenue Service, a senior historian from the\r\nDepartment of Defense, an editor from the Department of State, and\r\nsecretarial and administrative staff supplied by the General Services\r\nAdministration and other agencies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the assistance afforded by Federal agencies,\r\nthe Commission throughout its inquiry had the cooperation of\r\nrepresentatives of the city of Dallas and the State of Texas. The\r\nattorney general of Texas, Waggoner Carr, aided by two distinguished\r\nlawyers of that State, Robert G. Storey of Dallas, retired dean of\r\nthe Southern Methodist University Law School and former president of\r\nthe American Bar Association, and Leon Jaworski of Houston, former\r\npresident of the Texas State Bar Association, has been fully informed\r\nat all times as to the progress of the investigation, and has advanced\r\nsuch suggestions as he and his special assistants considered helpful\r\nto the accomplishment of the Commission\u2019s assignment. Attorney General\r\nCarr has promptly supplied the Commission with pertinent information\r\npossessed by Texas officials. Dallas officials, particularly those from\r\nthe police department, have fully complied with all requests made by\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nDuring December and early January the Commission received an increasing\r\nvolume of reports from Federal and State investigative agencies. Of\r\nprincipal importance was the five-volume report of the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation, submitted on December 9, 1963, which summarized\r\nthe results of the investigation conducted by the Bureau immediately\r\nafter the assassination. After reviewing this report, the Commission\r\nrequested the Federal Bureau of Investigation to furnish the underlying\r\ninvestigative materials relied upon in the summary report. The first\r\ninvestigative reports submitted in response to this request were\r\ndelivered to the Commission on December 20, 1963. On December 18, the\r\nSecret Service submitted a detailed report on security precautions\r\ntaken before President Kennedy\u2019s trip to Texas and a summary of the\r\nevents of November 22, as witnessed by Secret Service agents. A few\r\ndays later the Department of State submitted a report relating to\r\nOswald\u2019s defection to the Soviet Union in 1959, and his return to the\r\nUnited States in 1962. On January 7 and 11, 1964, the attorney general\r\nof Texas submitted an extensive set of investigative materials, largely\r\nDallas police reports, on the assassination of President Kennedy and\r\nthe killing of Oswald.\r\n\r\nAs these investigative reports were received, the staff began\r\nanalyzing and summarizing them. The members of the legal staff,\r\ndivided into teams, proceeded to organize the facts revealed by\r\nthese investigations, determine the issues, sort out the unresolved\r\nproblems, and recommend additional investigation by the Commission.", "start_char_idx": 9808, "end_char_idx": 14836, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c70ce89f-a65d-45d5-8e73-c177b40edf17": {"__data__": {"id_": "c70ce89f-a65d-45d5-8e73-c177b40edf17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc48df42-feea-4047-a39b-11cc21ba47e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "8f12cfb32dde225efdd7490526b2c9927bff147d656bb191878f5f85beb7ddb4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fdef7469-91b0-4a4d-b7db-eb0a7988626f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e4de3cd3e88c2602ebda8ebb0e5053c85393e2c51c11d1cab90fa343e78a137", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "On December 18, the\r\nSecret Service submitted a detailed report on security precautions\r\ntaken before President Kennedy\u2019s trip to Texas and a summary of the\r\nevents of November 22, as witnessed by Secret Service agents.

During the investigation the Commission on several\r\noccasions visited the scene of the assassination and other places in\r\nthe Dallas area pertinent to the inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe scope and detail of the investigative effort by the Federal and\r\nState agencies are suggested in part by statistics from the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation and the Secret Service. Immediately after the\r\nassassination more than 80 additional FBI personnel were transferred to\r\nthe Dallas office on a temporary basis to assist in the investigation.\r\nBeginning November 22, 1963, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nconducted approximately 25,000 interviews and reinterviews of persons\r\nhaving information of possible relevance to the investigation and by\r\nSeptember 11, 1964, submitted over 2,300 reports totaling approximately\r\n25,400 pages to the Commission. During the same period the Secret\r\nService conducted approximately 1,550 interviews and submitted 800\r\nreports totaling some 4,600 pages.\r\n\r\nBecause of the diligence, cooperation, and facilities of Federal\r\ninvestigative agencies, it was unnecessary for the Commission to\r\nemploy investigators other than the members of the Commission\u2019s legal\r\nstaff. The Commission recognized, however, that special measures were\r\nrequired whenever the facts or rumors called for an appraisal of the\r\nacts of the agencies themselves. The staff reviewed in detail the\r\nactions of several Federal agencies, particularly the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation, the Secret Service, the Central Intelligence Agency,\r\nand the Department of State. Initially the Commission requested the\r\nagencies to furnish all their reports relating to the assassination\r\nand their relationships with Oswald or Ruby. On the basis of these\r\nreports, the Commission submitted specific questions to the agency\r\ninvolved. Members of the staff followed up the answers by reviewing\r\nthe relevant files of each agency for additional information. In some\r\ninstances, members of the Commission also reviewed the files in person.\r\nFinally, the responsible officials of these agencies were called to\r\ntestify under oath. Dean Rusk, Secretary of State; C. Douglas Dillon,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury; John A. McCone, Director of the Central\r\nIntelligence Agency; J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation; and James J. Rowley, Chief of the Secret Service,\r\nappeared as witnesses and testified fully regarding their agencies\u2019\r\nparticipation in the matters under scrutiny by the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION HEARINGS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the information resulting from these investigations, the\r\nCommission has relied primarily on the facts disclosed by the sworn\r\ntestimony of the principal witnesses to the assassination and related\r\nevents.

Dean Rusk, Secretary of State; C. Douglas Dillon,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury; John A. McCone, Director of the Central\r\nIntelligence Agency; J.

Rowley, Chief of the Secret Service,\r\nappeared as witnesses and testified fully regarding their agencies\u2019\r\nparticipation in the matters under scrutiny by the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION HEARINGS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the information resulting from these investigations, the\r\nCommission has relied primarily on the facts disclosed by the sworn\r\ntestimony of the principal witnesses to the assassination and related\r\nevents. Beginning on February 3, 1964, the Commission and its staff\r\nhas taken the testimony of 552 witnesses. Of this number, 94 appeared\r\nbefore members of the Commission; 395 were questioned by members of\r\nthe Commission\u2019s legal staff; 61 supplied sworn affidavits; and 2\r\ngave statements.[F-4] Under Commission procedures, all witnesses were\r\nadvised that they had the right to the presence and the advice of their\r\nlawyer during the interrogation, with the corollary rights to raise\r\nobjections to any questions asked, to make any clarifying statement on\r\nthe record after the interrogation, and to purchase a copy of their\r\ntestimony.[F-5]\r\n\r\nCommission hearings were closed to the public unless the witness\r\nappearing before the Commission requested an open hearing. Under these\r\nprocedures, testimony of one witness was taken in a public hearing\r\non two occasions. No other witness requested a public hearing. The\r\nCommission concluded that the premature publication by it of testimony\r\nregarding the assassination or the subsequent killing of Oswald might\r\ninterfere with Ruby\u2019s rights to a fair and impartial trial on the\r\ncharges filed against him by the State of Texas. The Commission also\r\nrecognized that testimony would be presented before it which would\r\nbe inadmissible in judicial proceedings and might prejudice innocent\r\nparties if made public out of context. In addition to the witnesses\r\nwho appeared before the Commission, numerous others provided sworn\r\ndepositions, affidavits, and statements upon which the Commission\r\nhas relied. Since this testimony, as well as that taken before the\r\nCommission, could not always be taken in logical sequence, the\r\nCommission concluded that partial publication of testimony as the\r\ninvestigation progressed was impractical and could be misleading.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSION\u2019S FUNCTION\r\n\r\nThe Commission\u2019s most difficult assignments have been to uncover\r\nall the facts concerning the assassination of President Kennedy and\r\nto determine if it was in any way directed or encouraged by unknown\r\npersons at home or abroad. In this process, its objective has been to\r\nidentify the person or persons responsible for both the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy and the killing of Oswald through an examination\r\nof the evidence. The task has demanded unceasing appraisal of the\r\nevidence by the individual members of the Commission in their effort to\r\ndiscover the whole truth.\r\n\r\nThe procedures followed by the Commission in developing and assessing\r\nevidence necessarily differed from those of a court conducting a\r\ncriminal trial of a defendant present before it, since under our system\r\nthere is no provision for a posthumous trial. If Oswald had lived he\r\ncould have had a trial by American standards of justice where he would\r\nhave been able to exercise his full rights under the law. A judge and\r\njury would have presumed him innocent until proven guilty beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt. He might have furnished information which could have\r\naffected the course of his trial. He could have participated in and\r\nguided his defense. There could have been an examination to determine\r\nwhether he was sane under prevailing legal standards. All witnesses,\r\nincluding possibly the defendant, could have been subjected to\r\nsearching examination under the adversary system of American trials.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has functioned neither as a court presiding over an\r\nadversary proceeding nor as a prosecutor determined to prove a case,\r\nbut as a factfinding agency committed to the ascertainment of the\r\ntruth. In the course of the investigation of the facts and rumors\r\nsurrounding these matters, it was necessary to explore hearsay and\r\nother sources of information not admissible in a court proceeding\r\nobtained from persons who saw or heard and others in a position to\r\nobserve what occurred. In fairness to the alleged assassin and his\r\nfamily, the Commission on February 25, 1964, requested Walter E.\r\nCraig, president of the American Bar Association, to participate in\r\nthe investigation and to advise the Commission whether in his opinion\r\nthe proceedings conformed to the basic principles of American justice.\r\nMr. Craig accepted this assignment and participated fully and without\r\nlimitation.", "start_char_idx": 17985, "end_char_idx": 23029, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "012a1938-63dc-4d6a-8375-aa136ff8fb83": {"__data__": {"id_": "012a1938-63dc-4d6a-8375-aa136ff8fb83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fdef7469-91b0-4a4d-b7db-eb0a7988626f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "c865dd9c1ec5479a7e065db9ad7534a4da39f91cb2baf7f4f919f6ff21b4af82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5b9757b-6c35-4fff-8de4-296185913bb1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e11c83705d682d1a86b780941ba7540f36d5b0b3239f8ac32d5e61a5fdf8cdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Commission has functioned neither as a court presiding over an\r\nadversary proceeding nor as a prosecutor determined to prove a case,\r\nbut as a factfinding agency committed to the ascertainment of the\r\ntruth.

This report endeavors to fulfill\r\nthat right and to appraise this tragedy by the light of reason and the\r\nstandard of fairness. It has been prepared with a deep awareness of\r\nthe Commission\u2019s responsibility to present to the American people an\r\nobjective report of the facts relating to the assassination.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF EVENTS\r\n\r\nAt 11:40 a.m., c.s.t., on Friday, November 22, 1963, President John\r\nF. Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy, and their party arrived at Love Field,\r\nDallas, Tex. Behind them was the first day of a Texas trip planned\r\n5 months before by the President, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson,\r\nand John B. Connally, Jr., Governor of Texas. After leaving the White\r\nHouse on Thursday morning, the President had flown initially to San\r\nAntonio where Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson joined the party and\r\nthe President dedicated new research facilities at the U.S. Air Force\r\nSchool of Aerospace Medicine. Following a testimonial dinner in Houston\r\nfor U.S. Representative Albert Thomas, the President flew to Fort Worth\r\nwhere he spent the night and spoke at a large breakfast gathering on\r\nFriday.\r\n\r\nPlanned for later that day were a motorcade through downtown Dallas,\r\na luncheon speech at the Trade Mart, and a flight to Austin where\r\nthe President would attend a reception and speak at a Democratic\r\nfundraising dinner. From Austin he would proceed to the Texas ranch of\r\nthe Vice President. Evident on this trip were the varied roles which\r\nan American President performs--Head of State, Chief Executive, party\r\nleader, and, in this instance, prospective candidate for reelection.\r\n\r\nThe Dallas motorcade, it was hoped, would evoke a demonstration of the\r\nPresident\u2019s personal popularity in a city which he had lost in the 1960\r\nelection. Once it had been decided that the trip to Texas would span 2\r\ndays, those responsible for planning, primarily Governor Connally and\r\nKenneth O\u2019Donnell, a special assistant to the President, agreed that\r\na motorcade through Dallas would be desirable. The Secret Service was\r\ntold on November 8 that 45 minutes had been allotted to a motorcade\r\nprocession from Love Field to the site of a luncheon planned by Dallas\r\nbusiness and civic leaders in honor of the President. After considering\r\nthe facilities and security problems of several buildings, the Trade\r\nMart was chosen as the luncheon site. Given this selection, and in\r\naccordance with the customary practice of affording the greatest number\r\nof people an opportunity to see the President, the motorcade route\r\nselected was a natural one. The route was approved by the local host\r\ncommittee and White House representatives on November 18 and publicized\r\nin the local papers starting on November 19. This advance publicity\r\nmade it clear that the motorcade would leave Main Street and pass the\r\nintersection of Elm and Houston Streets as it proceeded to the Trade\r\nMart by way of the Stemmons Freeway.\r\n\r\nBy midmorning of November 22, clearing skies in Dallas dispelled the\r\nthreat of rain and the President greeted the crowds from his open\r\nlimousine without the \u201cbubbletop,\u201d which was at that time a plastic\r\nshield furnishing protection only against inclement weather. To the\r\nleft of the President in the rear seat was Mrs. Kennedy. In the jump\r\nseats were Governor Connally, who was in front of the President, and\r\nMrs. Connally at the Governor\u2019s left. Agent William R. Greer of the\r\nSecret Service was driving, and Agent Roy H. Kellerman was sitting to\r\nhis right.\r\n\r\nDirectly behind the Presidential limousine was an open \u201cfollowup\u201d car\r\nwith eight Secret Service agents, two in the front seat, two in the\r\nrear, and two on each running board. These agents, in accordance with\r\nnormal Secret Service procedures, were instructed to scan the crowds,\r\nthe roofs, and windows of buildings, overpasses, and crossings for\r\nsigns of trouble. Behind the \u201cfollowup\u201d car was the Vice-Presidential\r\ncar carrying the Vice President and Mrs. Johnson and Senator Ralph W.\r\nYarborough. Next were a Vice-Presidential \u201cfollowup\u201d car and several\r\ncars and buses for additional dignitaries, press representatives, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe motorcade left Love Field shortly after 11:50 a.m., and proceeded\r\nthrough residential neighborhoods, stopping twice at the President\u2019s\r\nrequest to greet well-wishers among the friendly crowds.", "start_char_idx": 49093, "end_char_idx": 53576, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b52379e-e79e-4711-b6de-557014d30d27": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b52379e-e79e-4711-b6de-557014d30d27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "55ada92e-3369-4839-a449-d7eacf82f2c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "3e0e1ff4ef94d0971ab6dff306bd7b70dc7e50b45f28aa10f4897027ba3cfced", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a54e0552-2d13-4af5-a9d5-f589c5028ae6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "03e4d964ea36a736be743773501308595e7123f7af930430e147278bc8f7e8f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Directly behind the Presidential limousine was an open \u201cfollowup\u201d car\r\nwith eight Secret Service agents, two in the front seat, two in the\r\nrear, and two on each running board.

Each time\r\nthe President\u2019s car halted, Secret Service agents from the \u201cfollowup\u201d\r\ncar moved forward to assume a protective stance near the President\r\nand Mrs. Kennedy. As the motorcade reached Main Street, a principal\r\neast-west artery in downtown Dallas, the welcome became tumultuous.\r\nAt the extreme west end of Main Street the motorcade turned right on\r\nHouston Street and proceeded north for one block in order to make a\r\nleft turn on Elm Street, the most direct and convenient approach to the\r\nStemmons Freeway and the Trade Mart. As the President\u2019s car approached\r\nthe intersection of Houston and Elm Streets, there loomed directly\r\nahead on the intersection\u2019s northwest corner a seven-story, orange\r\nbrick warehouse and office building, the Texas School Book Depository.\r\nRiding in the Vice President\u2019s car, Agent Rufus W. Youngblood of the\r\nSecret Service noticed that the clock atop the building indicated 12:30\r\np.m., the scheduled arrival time at the Trade Mart.\r\n\r\nThe President\u2019s car which had been going north made a sharp turn\r\ntoward the southwest onto Elm Street. At a speed of about 11 miles per\r\nhour, it started down the gradual descent toward a railroad overpass\r\nunder which the motorcade would proceed before reaching the Stemmons\r\nFreeway. The front of the Texas School Book Depository was now on the\r\nPresident\u2019s right, and he waved to the crowd assembled there as he\r\npassed the building. Dealey Plaza--an open, landscaped area marking the\r\nwestern end of downtown Dallas--stretched out to the President\u2019s left.\r\nA Secret Service agent riding in the motorcade radioed the Trade Mart\r\nthat the President would arrive in 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nSeconds later shots resounded in rapid succession. The President\u2019s\r\nhands moved to his neck. He appeared to stiffen momentarily and lurch\r\nslightly forward in his seat. A bullet had entered the base of the back\r\nof his neck slightly to the right of the spine. It traveled downward\r\nand exited from the front of the neck, causing a nick in the left lower\r\nportion of the knot in the President\u2019s necktie. Before the shooting\r\nstarted, Governor Connally had been facing toward the crowd on the\r\nright. He started to turn toward the left and suddenly felt a blow on\r\nhis back. The Governor had been hit by a bullet which entered at the\r\nextreme right side of his back at a point below his right armpit. The\r\nbullet traveled through his chest in a downward and forward direction,\r\nexited below his right nipple, passed through his right wrist which had\r\nbeen in his lap, and then caused a wound to his left thigh. The force\r\nof the bullet\u2019s impact appeared to spin the Governor to his right, and\r\nMrs. Connally pulled him down into her lap. Another bullet then struck\r\nPresident Kennedy in the rear portion of his head, causing a massive\r\nand fatal wound. The President fell to the left into Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s lap.\r\n\r\nSecret Service Agent Clinton J. Hill, riding on the left running board\r\nof the \u201cfollowup\u201d car, heard a noise which sounded like a firecracker\r\nand saw the President suddenly lean forward and to the left. Hill\r\njumped off the car and raced toward the President\u2019s limousine. In the\r\nfront seat of the Vice-Presidential car, Agent Youngblood heard an\r\nexplosion and noticed unusual movements in the crowd. He vaulted into\r\nthe rear seat and sat on the Vice President in order to protect him.\r\nAt the same time Agent Kellerman in the front seat of the Presidential\r\nlimousine turned to observe the President.", "start_char_idx": 52735, "end_char_idx": 57051, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a54e0552-2d13-4af5-a9d5-f589c5028ae6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a54e0552-2d13-4af5-a9d5-f589c5028ae6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b52379e-e79e-4711-b6de-557014d30d27", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "451c16901db0a0e6b130aa9c837f7eea4877f298094e5a1c520f084221b8f3c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "04da64aa-738c-4d8b-852a-a2dea42fdc59", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4bbac0f5c619944331a4c3c26c4a193b894fde5b8c018be34f25a20c19d169a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Connally pulled him down into her lap.

Hill pushed her back into the\r\nrear seat and shielded the stricken President and Mrs. Kennedy as the\r\nPresident\u2019s car proceeded at high speed to Parkland Memorial Hospital,\r\n4 miles away.\r\n\r\nAt Parkland, the President was immediately treated by a team of\r\nphysicians who had been alerted for the President\u2019s arrival by the\r\nDallas Police Department as the result of a radio message from the\r\nmotorcade after the shooting. The doctors noted irregular breathing\r\nmovements and a possible heartbeat, although they could not detect a\r\npulsebeat. They observed the extensive wound in the President\u2019s head\r\nand a small wound approximately one-fourth inch in diameter in the\r\nlower third of his neck. In an effort to facilitate breathing, the\r\nphysicians performed a tracheotomy by enlarging the throat wound and\r\ninserting a tube. Totally absorbed in the immediate task of trying to\r\npreserve the President\u2019s life, the attending doctors never turned the\r\nPresident over for an examination of his back. At 1 p.m., after all\r\nheart activity ceased and the Last Rites were administered by a priest,\r\nPresident Kennedy was pronounced dead. Governor Connally underwent\r\nsurgery and ultimately recovered from his serious wounds.\r\n\r\nUpon learning of the President\u2019s death, Vice President Johnson left\r\nParkland Hospital under close guard and proceeded to the Presidential\r\nplane at Love Field. Mrs. Kennedy, accompanying her husband\u2019s body,\r\nboarded the plane shortly thereafter. At 2:38 p.m., in the central\r\ncompartment of the plane, Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the 36th\r\nPresident of the United States by Federal District Court Judge Sarah T.\r\nHughes. The plane left immediately for Washington, D.C., arriving at\r\nAndrews AFB, Md., at 5:58 p.m., e.s.t. The President\u2019s body was taken\r\nto the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Md., where it was given\r\na complete pathological examination. The autopsy disclosed the large\r\nhead wound observed at Parkland and the wound in the front of the neck\r\nwhich had been enlarged by the Parkland doctors when they performed the\r\ntracheotomy. Both of these wounds were described in the autopsy report\r\nas being \u201cpresumably of exit.\u201d In addition the autopsy revealed a small\r\nwound of entry in the rear of the President\u2019s skull and another wound\r\nof entry near the base of the back of the neck. The autopsy report\r\nstated the cause of death as \u201cGunshot wound, head,\u201d and the bullets\r\nwhich struck the President were described as having been fired \u201cfrom a\r\npoint behind and somewhat above the level of the deceased.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the scene of the shooting, there was evident confusion at the\r\noutset concerning the point of origin of the shots. Witnesses differed\r\nin their accounts of the direction from which the sound of the shots\r\nemanated. Within a few minutes, however, attention centered on the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building as the source of the shots.\r\nThe building was occupied by a private corporation, the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Co., which distributed school textbooks of several\r\npublishers and leased space to representatives of the publishers.

One eyewitness, Howard L. Brennan,\r\nhad been watching the parade from a point on Elm Street directly\r\nopposite and facing the building. He promptly told a policeman that he\r\nhad seen a slender man, about 5 feet 10 inches, in his early thirties,\r\ntake deliberate aim from the sixth-floor corner window and fire a rifle\r\nin the direction of the President\u2019s car. Brennan thought he might be\r\nable to identify the man since he had noticed him in the window a few\r\nminutes before the motorcade made the turn onto Elm Street. At 12:34\r\np.m., the Dallas police radio mentioned the Depository Building as\r\na possible source of the shots, and at 12:45 p.m., the police radio\r\nbroadcast a description of the suspected assassin based primarily on\r\nBrennan\u2019s observations.\r\n\r\nWhen the shots were fired, a Dallas motorcycle patrolman, Marrion L.\r\nBaker, was riding in the motorcade at a point several cars behind the\r\nPresident. He had turned right from Main Street onto Houston Street\r\nand was about 200 feet south of Elm Street when he heard a shot.\r\nBaker, having recently returned from a week of deer hunting, was\r\ncertain the shot came from a high-powered rifle. He looked up and saw\r\npigeons scattering in the air from their perches on the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Building. He raced his motorcycle to the building,\r\ndismounted, scanned the area to the west and pushed his way through the\r\nspectators toward the entrance. There he encountered Roy Truly, the\r\nbuilding superintendent, who offered Baker his help. They entered the\r\nbuilding, and ran toward the two elevators in the rear. Finding that\r\nboth elevators were on an upper floor, they dashed up the stairs. Not\r\nmore than 2 minutes had elapsed since the shooting.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the second-floor landing on their way up to the top\r\nof the building, Patrolman Baker thought he caught a glimpse of someone\r\nthrough the small glass window in the door separating the hall area\r\nnear the stairs from the small vestibule leading into the lunchroom.\r\nGun in hand, he rushed to the door and saw a man about 20 feet away\r\nwalking toward the other end of the lunchroom. The man was emptyhanded.\r\nAt Baker\u2019s command, the man turned and approached him. Truly, who had\r\nstarted up the stairs to the third floor ahead of Baker, returned\r\nto see what had delayed the patrolman. Baker asked Truly whether he\r\nknew the man in the lunchroom. Truly replied that the man worked in\r\nthe building, whereupon Baker turned from the man and proceeded, with\r\nTruly, up the stairs. The man they encountered had started working\r\nin the Texas School Book Depository Building on October 16, 1963. His\r\nfellow workers described him as very quiet--a \u201cloner.\u201d His name was Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nWithin about 1 minute after his encounter with Baker and Truly, Oswald\r\nwas seen passing through the second-floor offices. In his hand was a\r\nfull \u201cCoke\u201d bottle which he had purchased from a vending machine in\r\nthe lunchroom. He was walking toward the front of the building where\r\na passenger elevator and a short flight of stairs provided access to\r\nthe main entrance of the building on the first floor. Approximately 7\r\nminutes later, at about 12:40 p.m., Oswald boarded a bus at a point on\r\nElm Street seven short blocks east of the Depository Building. The bus\r\nwas traveling west toward the very building from which Oswald had come.\r\nIts route lay through the Oak Cliff section in southwest Dallas, where\r\nit would pass seven blocks east of the roominghouse in which Oswald was\r\nliving, at 1026 North Beckley Avenue.

On the bus was Mrs. Mary Bledsoe,\r\none of Oswald\u2019s former landladies who immediately recognized him.\r\nOswald stayed on the bus approximately 3 or 4 minutes, during which\r\ntime it proceeded only two blocks because of the traffic jam created by\r\nthe motorcade and the assassination. Oswald then left the bus.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later he entered a vacant taxi four blocks away and asked\r\nthe driver to take him to a point on North Beckley Avenue several\r\nblocks beyond his roominghouse. The trip required 5 or 6 minutes. At\r\nabout 1 p.m. Oswald arrived at the roominghouse. The housekeeper, Mrs.\r\nEarlene Roberts, was surprised to see Oswald at midday and remarked\r\nto him that he seemed to be in quite a hurry. He made no reply. A few\r\nminutes later Oswald emerged from his room zipping up his jacket and\r\nrushed out of the house.\r\n\r\nApproximately 14 minutes later, and just 45 minutes after the\r\nassassination, another violent shooting occurred in Dallas. The victim\r\nwas Patrolman J.\u00a0D. Tippit of the Dallas police, an officer with a\r\ngood record during his more than 11 years with the police force. He\r\nwas shot near the intersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, about\r\nnine-tenths of a mile from Oswald\u2019s roominghouse. At the time of the\r\nassassination, Tippit was alone in his patrol car, the routine practice\r\nfor most police patrol cars at this time of day. He had been ordered by\r\nradio at 12:45 p.m. to proceed to the central Oak Cliff area as part of\r\na concentration of patrol car activity around the center of the city\r\nfollowing the assassination. At 12:54 Tippit radioed that he had moved\r\nas directed and would be available for any emergency. By this time the\r\npolice radio had broadcast several messages alerting the police to\r\nthe suspect described by Brennan at the scene of the assassination--a\r\nslender white male, about 30 years old, 5 feet 10 inches and weighing\r\nabout 165 pounds.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 1:15 p.m., Tippit was driving slowly in an easterly\r\ndirection on East 10th Street in Oak Cliff. About 100 feet past the\r\nintersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, Tippit pulled up\r\nalongside a man walking in the same direction. The man met the general\r\ndescription of the suspect wanted in connection with the assassination.\r\nHe walked over to Tippit\u2019s car, rested his arms on the door on the\r\nright-hand side of the car, and apparently exchanged words with Tippit\r\nthrough the window. Tippit opened the door on the left side and started\r\nto walk around the front of his car. As he reached the front wheel on\r\nthe driver\u2019s side, the man on the sidewalk drew a revolver and fired\r\nseveral shots in rapid succession, hitting Tippit four times and\r\nkilling him instantly. An automobile repairman, Domingo Benavides,\r\nheard the shots and stopped his pickup truck on the opposite side of\r\nthe street about 25 feet in front of Tippit\u2019s car. He observed the\r\ngunman start back toward Patton Avenue, removing the empty cartridge\r\ncases from the gun as he went. Benavides rushed to Tippit\u2019s side. The\r\npatrolman, apparently dead, was lying on his revolver, which was out\r\nof its holster. Benavides promptly reported the shooting to police\r\nheadquarters over the radio in Tippit\u2019s car.

Standing on the northwest corner\r\nof 10th Street and Patton Avenue was Helen Markham, who had been\r\nwalking south on Patton Avenue and had seen both the killer and Tippit\r\ncross the intersection in front of her as she waited on the curb for\r\ntraffic to pass. She witnessed the shooting and then saw the man with a\r\ngun in his hand walk back toward the corner and cut across the lawn of\r\nthe corner house as he started south on Patton Avenue.\r\n\r\nIn the corner house itself, Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis and her\r\nsister-in-law, Mrs. Virginia Davis, heard the shots and rushed to the\r\ndoor in time to see the man walk rapidly across the lawn shaking a\r\nrevolver as if he were emptying it of cartridge cases. Later that day\r\neach woman found a cartridge case near the house. As the gunman turned\r\nthe corner he passed alongside a taxicab which was parked on Patton\r\nAvenue, a few feet from 10th Street. The driver, William W. Scoggins,\r\nhad seen the slaying and was now crouched behind his cab on the street\r\nside. As the gunman cut through the shrubbery on the lawn, Scoggins\r\nlooked up and saw the man approximately 12 feet away. In his hand was a\r\npistol and he muttered words which sounded to Scoggins like \u201cpoor dumb\r\ncop\u201d or \u201cpoor damn cop.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter passing Scoggins, the gunman crossed to the west side of Patton\r\nAvenue and ran south toward Jefferson Boulevard, a main Oak Cliff\r\nthoroughfare. On the east side of Patton, between 10th Street and\r\nJefferson Boulevard, Ted Callaway, a used car salesman, heard the shots\r\nand ran to the sidewalk. As the man with the gun rushed past, Callaway\r\nshouted \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d The man merely shrugged, ran on to Jefferson\r\nBoulevard and turned right. On the next corner was a gas station with a\r\nparking lot in the rear. The assailant ran into the lot, discarded his\r\njacket and then continued his flight west on Jefferson.\r\n\r\nIn a shoe store a few blocks farther west on Jefferson, the manager,\r\nJohnny Calvin Brewer, heard the siren of a police car moments after\r\nthe radio in his store announced the shooting of the police officer in\r\nOak Cliff. Brewer saw a man step quickly into the entranceway of the\r\nstore and stand there with his back toward the street. When the police\r\ncar made a =U=-turn and headed back in the direction of the Tippit\r\nshooting, the man left and Brewer followed him. He saw the man enter\r\nthe Texas Theatre, a motion picture house about 60 feet away, without\r\nbuying a ticket. Brewer pointed this out to the cashier, Mrs. Julia\r\nPostal, who called the police. The time was shortly after 1:40 p.m.\r\n\r\nAt 1:29 p.m., the police radio had noted the similarity in the\r\ndescriptions of the suspects in the Tippit shooting and the\r\nassassination.

After a brief struggle McDonald and\r\nseveral other police officers disarmed and handcuffed the suspect and\r\ndrove him to police headquarters, arriving at approximately 2 p.m.\r\n\r\nFollowing the assassination, police cars had rushed to the Texas School\r\nBook Depository in response to the many radio messages reporting that\r\nthe shots had been fired from the Depository Building. Inspector J.\r\nHerbert Sawyer of the Dallas Police Department arrived at the scene\r\nshortly after hearing the first of these police radio messages at 12:34\r\np.m. Some of the officers who had been assigned to the area of Elm\r\nand Houston Streets for the motorcade were talking to witnesses and\r\nwatching the building when Sawyer arrived. Sawyer entered the building\r\nand rode a passenger elevator to the fourth floor, which was the top\r\nfloor for this elevator. He conducted a quick search, returned to the\r\nmain floor and, between approximately 12:37 and 12:40 p.m., ordered\r\nthat no one be permitted to leave the building.\r\n\r\nShortly before 1 p.m. Capt. J. Will Fritz, chief of the homicide and\r\nrobbery bureau of the Dallas Police Department, arrived to take charge\r\nof the investigation. Searching the sixth floor, Deputy Sheriff Luke\r\nMooney noticed a pile of cartons in the southeast corner. He squeezed\r\nthrough the boxes and realized immediately that he had discovered the\r\npoint from which the shots had been fired. On the floor were three\r\nempty cartridge cases. A carton had apparently been placed on the floor\r\nat the side of the window so that a person sitting on the carton could\r\nlook down Elm Street toward the overpass and scarcely be noticed from\r\nthe outside. Between this carton and the half-open window were three\r\nadditional cartons arranged at such an angle that a rifle resting on\r\nthe top carton would be aimed directly at the motorcade as it moved\r\naway from the building. The high stack of boxes, which first attracted\r\nMooney\u2019s attention, effectively screened a person at the window from\r\nthe view of anyone else on the floor.\r\n\r\nMooney\u2019s discovery intensified the search for additional evidence on\r\nthe sixth floor, and at 1:22 p.m., approximately 10 minutes after the\r\ncartridge cases were found, Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone turned his\r\nflashlight in the direction of two rows of boxes in the northwest\r\ncorner near the staircase. Stuffed between the two rows was a\r\nbolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight. The rifle was not touched\r\nuntil it could be photographed. When Lt. J.\u00a0C. Day of the police\r\nidentification bureau decided that the wooden stock and the metal knob\r\nat the end of the bolt contained no prints, he held the rifle by the\r\nstock while Captain Fritz ejected a live shell by operating the bolt.\r\nLieutenant Day promptly noted that stamped on the rifle itself was the\r\nserial number \u201cC2766\u201d as well as the markings \u201c1940\u201d \u201cMADE ITALY\u201d and\r\n\u201cCAL. 6.5.\u201d The rifle was about 40 inches long and when disassembled it\r\ncould fit into a handmade paper sack which, after the assassination,\r\nwas found in the southeast corner of the building within a few feet of\r\nthe cartridge cases.\r\n\r\nAs Fritz and Day were completing their examination of this rifle on the\r\nsixth floor, Roy Truly, the building superintendent, approached with\r\ninformation which he felt should be brought to the attention of the\r\npolice.

He arrived\r\nat headquarters shortly after 2 p.m. and asked two detectives to pick\r\nup the employee who was missing from the Texas School Book Depository.\r\nStanding nearby were the police officers who had just arrived with\r\nthe man arrested in the Texas Theatre. When Fritz mentioned the name\r\nof the missing employee, he learned that the man was already in the\r\ninterrogation room. The missing School Book Depository employee and the\r\nsuspect who had been apprehended in the Texas Theatre were one and the\r\nsame--Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nThe suspect Fritz was about to question in connection with the\r\nassassination of the President and the murder of a policeman was born\r\nin New Orleans on October 18, 1939, 2 months after the death of his\r\nfather. His mother, Marguerite Claverie Oswald, had two older children.\r\nOne, John Pic, was a half-brother to Lee from an earlier marriage which\r\nhad ended in divorce. The other was Robert Oswald, a full brother to\r\nLee and 5 years older. When Lee Oswald was 3, Mrs. Oswald placed him in\r\nan orphanage where his brother and half-brother were already living,\r\nprimarily because she had to work.\r\n\r\nIn January 1944, when Lee was 4, he was taken out of the orphanage, and\r\nshortly thereafter his mother moved with him to Dallas, Tex., where\r\nthe older boys joined them at the end of the school year. In May of\r\n1945 Marguerite Oswald married her third husband, Edwin A. Ekdahl.\r\nWhile the two older boys attended a military boarding school, Lee\r\nlived at home and developed a warm attachment to Ekdahl, occasionally\r\naccompanying his mother and stepfather on business trips around the\r\ncountry. Lee started school in Benbrook, Tex., but in the fall of\r\n1946, after a separation from Ekdahl, Marguerite Oswald reentered Lee\r\nin the first grade in Covington, La. In January 1947, while Lee was\r\nstill in the first grade, the family moved to Fort Worth, Tex., as the\r\nresult of an attempted reconciliation between Ekdahl and Lee\u2019s mother.\r\nA year and a half later, before Lee was 9, his mother was divorced\r\nfrom her third husband as the result of a divorce action instituted by\r\nEkdahl. Lee\u2019s school record during the next 5\u00bd years in Fort Worth was\r\naverage, although generally it grew poorer each year. The comments of\r\nteachers and others who knew him at that time do not reveal any unusual\r\npersonality traits or characteristics.\r\n\r\nAnother change for Lee Oswald occurred in August 1952, a few months\r\nafter he completed the sixth grade. Marguerite Oswald and her\r\n12-year-old son moved to New York City where Marguerite\u2019s oldest\r\nson, John Pic, was stationed with the Coast Guard. The ensuing year\r\nand one-half in New York was marked by Lee\u2019s refusals to attend\r\nschool and by emotional and psychological problems of a seemingly\r\nserious nature. Because he had become a chronic school truant, Lee\r\nunderwent psychiatric study at Youth House, an institution in New\r\nYork for juveniles who have had truancy problems or difficulties\r\nwith the law, and who appear to require psychiatric observation,\r\nor other types of guidance. The social worker assigned to his case\r\ndescribed him as \u201cseriously detached\u201d and \u201cwithdrawn\u201d and noted \u201ca\r\nrather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved,\r\naffectionless youngster.\u201d Lee expressed the feeling to the social\r\nworker that his mother did not care for him and regarded him as a\r\nburden. He experienced fantasies about being all powerful and hurting\r\npeople, but during his stay at Youth House he was apparently not\r\na behavior problem.

The chief psychiatrist of Youth House diagnosed Lee\u2019s\r\nproblem as a \u201cpersonality pattern disturbance with schizoid features\r\nand passive-aggressive tendencies.\u201d He concluded that the boy was \u201can\r\nemotionally, quite disturbed youngster\u201d and recommended psychiatric\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn May 1953, after having been at Youth House for 3 weeks, Lee Oswald\r\nreturned to school where his attendance and grades temporarily\r\nimproved. By the following fall, however, the probation officer\r\nreported that virtually every teacher complained about the boy\u2019s\r\nbehavior. His mother insisted that he did not need psychiatric\r\nassistance. Although there was apparently some improvement in Lee\u2019s\r\nbehavior during the next few months, the court recommended further\r\ntreatment. In January 1954, while Lee\u2019s case was still pending,\r\nMarguerite and Lee left for New Orleans, the city of Lee\u2019s birth.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to New Orleans, Lee maintained mediocre grades but\r\nhad no obvious behavior problems. Neighbors and others who knew him\r\noutside of school remembered him as a quiet, solitary and introverted\r\nboy who read a great deal and whose vocabulary made him quite\r\narticulate. About 1 month after he started the 10th grade and 11 days\r\nbefore his 16th birthday in October 1955, he brought to school a note\r\npurportedly written by his mother, stating that the family was moving\r\nto California. The note was written by Lee. A few days later he dropped\r\nout of school and almost immediately tried to join the Marine Corps.\r\nBecause he was only 16, he was rejected.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving school Lee worked for the next 10 months at several jobs\r\nin New Orleans as an office messenger or clerk. It was during this\r\nperiod that he started to read communist literature. Occasionally,\r\nin conversations with others, he praised communism and expressed to\r\nhis fellow employees a desire to join the Communist Party. At about\r\nthis time, when he was not yet 17, he wrote to the Socialist Party of\r\nAmerica, professing his belief in Marxism.\r\n\r\nAnother move followed in July 1956 when Lee and his mother returned\r\nto Fort Worth. He reentered high school but again dropped out after\r\na few weeks and enlisted in the Marine Corps on October 24, 1956, 6\r\ndays after his 17th birthday. On December 21, 1956, during boot camp\r\nin San Diego, Oswald fired a score of 212 for record with the M-1\r\nrifle--2 points over the minimum for a rating of \u201csharpshooter\u201d on a\r\nmarksman/sharpshooter/expert scale. After his basic training, Oswald\r\nreceived training in aviation fundamentals and then in radar scanning.\r\n\r\nMost people who knew Oswald in the Marines described him as a \u201cloner\u201d\r\nwho resented the exercise of authority by others. He spent much of\r\nhis free time reading. He was court-martialed once for possessing an\r\nunregistered privately owned weapon and, on another occasion, for using\r\nprovocative language to a noncommissioned officer. He was, however,\r\ngenerally able to comply with Marine discipline, even though his\r\nexperiences in the Marine Corps did not live up to his expectations.\r\n\r\nOswald served 15 months overseas until November 1958, most of it in\r\nJapan.

Oswald again fired the M-1 rifle for record\r\non May 6, 1959, and this time he shot a score of 191 on a shorter\r\ncourse than before, only 1 point over the minimum required to be a\r\n\u201cmarksman.\u201d According to one of his fellow marines, Oswald was not\r\nparticularly interested in his rifle performance, and his unit was not\r\nexpected to exhibit the usual rifle proficiency. During this period\r\nhe expressed strong admiration for Fidel Castro and an interest in\r\njoining the Cuban army. He tried to impress those around him as an\r\nintellectual, but his thinking appeared to some as shallow and rigid.\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s Marine service terminated on September 11, 1959, when at his\r\nown request he was released from active service a few months ahead\r\nof his scheduled release. He offered as the reason for his release\r\nthe ill health and economic plight of his mother. He returned to Fort\r\nWorth, remained with his mother only 3 days and left for New Orleans,\r\ntelling his mother he planned to get work there in the shipping or\r\nimport-export business. In New Orleans he booked passage on the\r\nfreighter SS _Marion Lykes_, which sailed from New Orleans to Le Havre,\r\nFrance, on September 20, 1959.\r\n\r\nLee Harvey Oswald had presumably planned this step in his life for\r\nquite some time. In March of 1959 he had applied to the Albert\r\nSchweitzer College in Switzerland for admission to the spring 1960\r\nterm. His letter of application contained many blatant falsehoods\r\nconcerning his qualifications and background. A few weeks before his\r\ndischarge he had applied for and obtained a passport, listing the\r\nSoviet Union as one of the countries which he planned to visit. During\r\nhis service in the Marines he had saved a comparatively large sum of\r\nmoney, possibly as much as $1,500, which would appear to have been\r\naccomplished by considerable frugality and apparently for a specific\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accumulated fund soon became known. On October 16,\r\n1959, Oswald arrived in Moscow by train after crossing the border\r\nfrom Finland, where he had secured a visa for a 6-day stay in the\r\nSoviet Union. He immediately applied for Soviet citizenship. On the\r\nafternoon of October 21, 1959, Oswald was ordered to leave the Soviet\r\nUnion by 8 p.m. that evening. That same afternoon in his hotel room\r\nOswald, in an apparent suicide attempt, slashed his left wrist. He\r\nwas hospitalized immediately. On October 31, 3 days after his release\r\nfrom the hospital, Oswald appeared at the American Embassy, announced\r\nthat he wished to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a Russian\r\ncitizen, and handed the Embassy officer a written statement he had\r\nprepared for the occasion. When asked his reasons, Oswald replied, \u201cI\r\nam a Marxist.\u201d Oswald never formally complied with the legal steps\r\nnecessary to renounce his American citizenship. The Soviet Government\r\ndid not grant his request for citizenship, but in January 1960 he was\r\ngiven permission to remain in the Soviet Union on a year-to-year basis.\r\nAt the same time Oswald was sent to Minsk where he worked in a radio\r\nfactory as an unskilled laborer. In January 1961 his permission to\r\nremain in the Soviet Union was extended for another year.

A few weeks\r\nlater, in February 1961, he wrote to the American Embassy in Moscow\r\nexpressing a desire to return to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe following month Oswald met a 19-year-old Russian girl, Marina\r\nNikolaevna Prusakova, a pharmacist, who had been brought up in\r\nLeningrad but was then living with an aunt and uncle in Minsk. They\r\nwere married on April 30, 1961. Throughout the following year he\r\ncarried on a correspondence with American and Soviet authorities\r\nseeking approval for the departure of himself and his wife to the\r\nUnited States. In the course of this effort, Oswald and his wife\r\nvisited the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in July of 1961. Primarily on the\r\nbasis of an interview and questionnaire completed there, the Embassy\r\nconcluded that Oswald had not lost his citizenship, a decision\r\nsubsequently ratified by the Department of State in Washington, D.C.\r\nUpon their return to Minsk, Oswald and his wife filed with the Soviet\r\nauthorities for permission to leave together. Their formal application\r\nwas made in July 1961, and on December 25, 1961, Marina Oswald was\r\nadvised it would be granted.\r\n\r\nA daughter was born to the Oswalds in February 1962. In the months that\r\nfollowed they prepared for their return to the United States. On May 9,\r\n1962, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, at the request\r\nof the Department of State, agreed to waive a restriction under the\r\nlaw which would have prevented the issuance of a United States visa to\r\nOswald\u2019s Russian wife until she had left the Soviet Union. They finally\r\nleft Moscow on June 1, 1962, and were assisted in meeting their travel\r\nexpenses by a loan of $435.71 from the U.S. Department of State. Two\r\nweeks later they arrived in Fort Worth, Tex.\r\n\r\nFor a few weeks Oswald, his wife and child lived with Oswald\u2019s brother\r\nRobert. After a similar stay with Oswald\u2019s mother, they moved into\r\ntheir own apartment in early August. Oswald obtained a job on July\r\n16 as a sheet metal worker. During this period in Fort Worth, Oswald\r\nwas interviewed twice by agents of the FBI. The report of the first\r\ninterview, which occurred on June 26, described him as arrogant and\r\nunwilling to discuss the reasons why he had gone to the Soviet Union.\r\nOswald denied that he was involved in Soviet intelligence activities\r\nand promised to advise the FBI if Soviet representatives ever\r\ncommunicated with him. He was interviewed again on August 16, when he\r\ndisplayed a less belligerent attitude and once again agreed to inform\r\nthe FBI of any attempt to enlist him in intelligence activities.\r\n\r\nIn early October 1962 Oswald quit his job at the sheet metal plant\r\nand moved to Dallas. While living in Forth Worth the Oswalds had been\r\nintroduced to a group of Russian-speaking people in the Dallas-Fort\r\nWorth area. Many of them assisted the Oswalds by providing small\r\namounts of food, clothing, and household items. Oswald himself was\r\ndisliked by almost all of this group whose help to the family was\r\nprompted primarily by sympathy for Marina Oswald and the child.\r\nDespite the fact that he had left the Soviet Union, disillusioned\r\nwith its Government, Oswald seemed more firmly committed than ever to\r\nhis concepts of Marxism.

Oswald himself was\r\ndisliked by almost all of this group whose help to the family was\r\nprompted primarily by sympathy for Marina Oswald and the child.\r\nDespite the fact that he had left the Soviet Union, disillusioned\r\nwith its Government, Oswald seemed more firmly committed than ever to\r\nhis concepts of Marxism. He showed disdain for democracy, capitalism,\r\nand American society in general. He was highly critical of the\r\nRussian-speaking group because they seemed devoted to American concepts\r\nof democracy and capitalism and were ambitious to improve themselves\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\nIn February 1963 the Oswalds met Ruth Paine at a social gathering. Ruth\r\nPaine was temporarily separated from her husband and living with her\r\ntwo children in their home in Irving, Tex., a suburb of Dallas. Because\r\nof an interest in the Russian language and sympathy for Marina Oswald,\r\nwho spoke no English and had little funds, Ruth Paine befriended Marina\r\nand, during the next 2 months, visited her on several occasions.\r\n\r\nOn April 6, 1963, Oswald lost his job with a photography firm. A few\r\ndays later, on April 10, he attempted to kill Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n(Resigned, U.S. Army), using a rifle which he had ordered by mail 1\r\nmonth previously under an assumed name. Marina Oswald learned of her\r\nhusband\u2019s act when she confronted him with a note which he had left,\r\ngiving her instructions in the event he did not return. That incident\r\nand their general economic difficulties impelled Marina Oswald to\r\nsuggest that her husband leave Dallas and go to New Orleans to look for\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOswald left for New Orleans on April 24, 1963. Ruth Paine, who knew\r\nnothing of the Walker shooting, invited Marina Oswald and the baby to\r\nstay with her in the Paines\u2019 modest home while Oswald sought work in\r\nNew Orleans. Early in May, upon receiving word from Oswald that he had\r\nfound a job, Ruth Paine drove Marina Oswald and the baby to New Orleans\r\nto rejoin Oswald.\r\n\r\nDuring the stay in New Orleans, Oswald formed a fictitious New Orleans\r\nChapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He posed as secretary of\r\nthis organization and represented that the president was A.\u00a0J. Hidell.\r\nIn reality, Hidell was a completely fictitious person created by\r\nOswald, the organization\u2019s only member. Oswald was arrested on August 9\r\nin connection with a scuffle which occurred while he was distributing\r\npro-Castro leaflets. The next day, while at the police station, he\r\nwas interviewed by an FBI agent after Oswald requested the police to\r\narrange such an interview. Oswald gave the agent false information\r\nabout his own background and was evasive in his replies concerning Fair\r\nPlay for Cuba activities. During the next 2 weeks Oswald appeared on\r\nradio programs twice, claiming to be the spokesman for the Fair Play\r\nfor Cuba Committee in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nOn July 19, 1963, Oswald lost his job as a greaser of coffee processing\r\nmachinery. In September, after an exchange of correspondence with\r\nMarina Oswald, Ruth Paine drove to New Orleans and on September 23,\r\ntransported Marina, the child, and the family belongings to Irving,\r\nTex. Ruth Paine suggested that Marina Oswald, who was expecting her\r\nsecond child in October, live at the Paine house until after the baby\r\nwas born. Oswald remained behind, ostensibly to find work either in\r\nHouston or some other city. Instead, he departed by bus for Mexico,\r\narriving in Mexico City on September 27, where he promptly visited\r\nthe Cuban and Russian Embassies. His stated objective was to obtain\r\nofficial permission to visit Cuba, on his way to the Soviet Union. The\r\nCuban Government would not grant his visa unless the Soviet Government\r\nwould also issue a visa permitting his entry into Russia. Oswald\u2019s\r\nefforts to secure these visas failed, and he left for Dallas, where he\r\narrived on October 3, 1963.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw his wife the next day, it was decided that Oswald would\r\nrent a room in Dallas and visit his family on weekends.

On the same day,\r\nat the suggestion of a neighbor, Mrs. Paine phoned the Texas School\r\nBook Depository and was told that there was a job opening. She informed\r\nOswald who was interviewed the following day at the Depository and\r\nstarted to work there on October 16, 1963.\r\n\r\nOn October 20 the Oswalds\u2019 second daughter was born. During October\r\nand November Oswald established a general pattern of weekend visits to\r\nIrving, arriving on Friday afternoon and returning to Dallas Monday\r\nmorning with a fellow employee, Buell Wesley Frazier, who lived near\r\nthe Paines. On Friday, November 15, Oswald remained in Dallas at the\r\nsuggestion of his wife who told him that the house would be crowded\r\nbecause of a birthday party for Ruth Paine\u2019s daughter. On Monday,\r\nNovember 18, Oswald and his wife quarreled bitterly during a telephone\r\nconversation, because she learned for the first time that he was living\r\nat the roominghouse under an assumed name. On Thursday, November 21,\r\nOswald told Frazier that he would like to drive to Irving to pick up\r\nsome curtain rods for an apartment in Dallas. His wife and Mrs. Paine\r\nwere quite surprised to see him since it was a Thursday night. They\r\nthought he had returned to make up after Monday\u2019s quarrel. He was\r\nconciliatory, but Marina Oswald was still angry.\r\n\r\nLater that evening, when Mrs. Paine had finished cleaning the kitchen,\r\nshe went into the garage and noticed that the light was burning. She\r\nwas certain that she had not left it on, although the incident appeared\r\nunimportant at the time. In the garage were most of the Oswalds\u2019\r\npersonal possessions. The following morning Oswald left while his wife\r\nwas still in bed feeding the baby. She did not see him leave the house,\r\nnor did Ruth Paine. On the dresser in their room he left his wedding\r\nring which he had never done before. His wallet containing $170 was\r\nleft intact in a dresser-drawer.\r\n\r\nOswald walked to Frazier\u2019s house about half a block away and placed a\r\nlong bulky package, made out of wrapping paper and tape, into the rear\r\nseat of the car. He told Frazier that the package contained curtain\r\nrods. When they reached the Depository parking lot, Oswald walked\r\nquickly ahead. Frazier followed and saw Oswald enter the Depository\r\nBuilding carrying the long bulky package with him.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning of November 22, Marina Oswald followed President\r\nKennedy\u2019s activities on television. She and Ruth Paine cried when they\r\nheard that the President had been shot. Ruth Paine translated the news\r\nof the shooting to Marina Oswald as it came over television, including\r\nthe report that the shots were probably fired from the building where\r\nOswald worked. When Marina Oswald heard this, she recalled the Walker\r\nepisode and the fact that her husband still owned the rifle. She went\r\nquietly to the Paine\u2019s garage where the rifle had been concealed in a\r\nblanket among their other belongings. It appeared to her that the rifle\r\nwas still there, although she did not actually open the blanket.\r\n\r\nAt about 3 p.m. the police arrived at the Paine house and asked Marina\r\nOswald whether her husband owned a rifle. She said that he did and then\r\nled them into the garage and pointed to the rolled up blanket. As a\r\npolice officer lifted it, the blanket hung limply over either side of\r\nhis arm.

Oswald denied having anything to do with the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy or the murder of Patrolman Tippit. He claimed that\r\nhe was eating lunch at the time of the assassination, and that he then\r\nspoke with his foreman for 5 to 10 minutes before going home. He denied\r\nthat he owned a rifle and when confronted, in a subsequent interview,\r\nwith a picture showing him holding a rifle and pistol, he claimed that\r\nhis face had been superimposed on someone else\u2019s body. He refused to\r\nanswer any questions about the presence in his wallet of a selective\r\nservice card with his picture and the name \u201cAlek J.

Reporters tried to interview Oswald during these\r\ntrips. Between Friday afternoon and Sunday morning he appeared in the\r\nhallway at least 16 times. The generally confused conditions outside\r\nand inside Captain Fritz\u2019 office increased the difficulty of police\r\nquestioning. Advised by the police that he could communicate with an\r\nattorney, Oswald made several telephone calls on Saturday in an effort\r\nto procure representation of his own choice and discussed the matter\r\nwith the president of the local bar association, who offered to obtain\r\ncounsel. Oswald declined the offer saying that he would first try to\r\nobtain counsel by himself. By Sunday morning he had not yet engaged an\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\nAt 7:10 p.m. on November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald was formally\r\nadvised that he had been charged with the murder of Patrolman J.D.\r\nTippit. Several witnesses to the Tippit slaying and to the subsequent\r\nflight of the gunman had positively identified Oswald in police\r\nlineups. While positive firearm identification evidence was not\r\navailable at the time, the revolver in Oswald\u2019s possession at the time\r\nof his arrest was of a type which could have fired the shots that\r\nkilled Tippit.\r\n\r\nThe formal charge against Oswald for the assassination of President\r\nKennedy was lodged shortly after 1:30 a.m., on Saturday, November 23.\r\nBy 10 p.m. of the day of the assassination, the FBI had traced the\r\nrifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository to\r\na mailorder house in Chicago which had purchased it from a distributor\r\nin New York. Approximately 6 hours later the Chicago firm advised\r\nthat this rifle had been ordered in March 1963 by an A. Hidel for\r\nshipment to post office box 2915, in Dallas, Tex., a box rented by\r\nOswald. Payment for the rifle was remitted by a money order signed by\r\nA. Hidell. By 6:45 p.m. on November 23, the FBI was able to advise\r\nthe Dallas police that, as a result of handwriting analysis of the\r\ndocuments used to purchase the rifle, it had concluded that the rifle\r\nhad been ordered by Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nThroughout Friday and Saturday, the Dallas police released to the\r\npublic many of the details concerning the alleged evidence against\r\nOswald.

They shouted questions at Oswald and flashed\r\ncameras at him. Among this group was a 52-year-old Dallas nightclub\r\noperator--Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, November 24, arrangements were made for Oswald\u2019s\r\ntransfer from the city jail to the Dallas County jail, about 1 mile\r\naway. The news media had been informed on Saturday night that the\r\ntransfer of Oswald would not take place until after 10 a.m. on Sunday.\r\nEarlier on Sunday, between 2:30 and 3 a.m., anonymous telephone calls\r\nthreatening Oswald\u2019s life had been received by the Dallas office of the\r\nFBI and by the office of the county sheriff. Nevertheless, on Sunday\r\nmorning, television, radio, and newspaper representatives crowded into\r\nthe basement to record the transfer. As viewed through television\r\ncameras, Oswald would emerge from a door in front of the cameras and\r\nproceed to the transfer vehicle. To the right of the cameras was a\r\n\u201cdown\u201d ramp from Main Street on the north. To the left was an \u201cup\u201d ramp\r\nleading to Commerce Street on the south.\r\n\r\nThe armored truck in which Oswald was to be transferred arrived shortly\r\nafter 11 a.m. Police officials then decided, however, that an unmarked\r\npolice car would be preferable for the trip because of its greater\r\nspeed and maneuverability. At approximately 11:20 a.m. Oswald emerged\r\nfrom the basement jail office flanked by detectives on either side and\r\nat his rear. He took a few steps toward the car and was in the glaring\r\nlight of the television cameras when a man suddenly darted out from\r\nan area on the right of the cameras where newsmen had been assembled.\r\nThe man was carrying a Colt .38 revolver in his right hand and, while\r\nmillions watched on television, he moved quickly to within a few feet\r\nof Oswald and fired one shot into Oswald\u2019s abdomen. Oswald groaned with\r\npain as he fell to the ground and quickly lost consciousness. Within 7\r\nminutes Oswald was at Parkland Hospital where, without having regained\r\nconsciousness, he was pronounced dead at 1:07 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe man who killed Oswald was Jack Ruby. He was instantly arrested and,\r\nminutes later, confined in a cell on the fifth floor of the Dallas\r\npolice jail. Under interrogation, he denied that the killing of Oswald\r\nwas in any way connected with a conspiracy involving the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy. He maintained that he had killed Oswald in a\r\ntemporary fit of depression and rage over the President\u2019s death. Ruby\r\nwas transferred the following day to the county jail without notice to\r\nthe press or to police officers not directly involved in the transfer.\r\nIndicted for the murder of Oswald by the State of Texas on November 26,\r\n1963, Ruby was found guilty on March 14, 1964, and sentenced to death.\r\nAs of September 1964, his case was pending on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThis Commission was created to ascertain the facts relating to the\r\npreceding summary of events and to consider the important questions\r\nwhich they raised. The Commission has addressed itself to this task and\r\nhas reached certain conclusions based on all the available evidence.\r\nNo limitations have been placed on the Commission\u2019s inquiry; it has\r\nconducted its own investigation, and all Government agencies have fully\r\ndischarged their responsibility to cooperate with the Commission in its\r\ninvestigation.

The Commission has addressed itself to this task and\r\nhas reached certain conclusions based on all the available evidence.\r\nNo limitations have been placed on the Commission\u2019s inquiry; it has\r\nconducted its own investigation, and all Government agencies have fully\r\ndischarged their responsibility to cooperate with the Commission in its\r\ninvestigation. These conclusions represent the reasoned judgment of\r\nall members of the Commission and are presented after an investigation\r\nwhich has satisfied the Commission that it has ascertained the truth\r\nconcerning the assassination of President Kennedy to the extent that a\r\nprolonged and thorough search makes this possible.\r\n\r\n1. The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor\r\nConnally were fired from the sixth floor window at the southeast corner\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository. This determination is based upon\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Witnesses at the scene of the assassination saw a rifle\r\n    being fired from the sixth floor window of the Depository\r\n    Building, and some witnesses saw a rifle in the window\r\n    immediately after the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The nearly whole bullet found on Governor Connally\u2019s\r\n    stretcher at Parkland Memorial Hospital and the two bullet\r\n    fragments found in the front seat of the Presidential limousine\r\n    were fired from the 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano rifle\r\n    found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building to the\r\n    exclusion of all other weapons.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The three used cartridge cases found near the window on\r\n    the sixth floor at the southeast corner of the building were\r\n    fired from the same rifle which fired the above-described\r\n    bullet and fragments, to the exclusion of all other weapons.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The windshield in the Presidential limousine was struck\r\n    by a bullet fragment on the inside surface of the glass, but\r\n    was not penetrated.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) The nature of the bullet wounds suffered by President\r\n    Kennedy and Governor Connally and the location of the car at\r\n    the time of the shots establish that the bullets were fired\r\n    from above and behind the Presidential limousine, striking the\r\n    President and the Governor as follows:\r\n\r\n    (1) President Kennedy was first struck by a bullet which\r\n    entered at the back of his neck and exited through the lower\r\n    front portion of his neck, causing a wound which would not\r\n    necessarily have been lethal. The President was struck a second\r\n    time by a bullet which entered the right-rear portion of his\r\n    head, causing a massive and fatal wound.\r\n\r\n    (2) Governor Connally was struck by a bullet which entered on\r\n    the right side of his back and traveled downward through the\r\n    right side of his chest, exiting below his right nipple. This\r\n    bullet then passed through his right wrist and entered his left\r\n    thigh where it caused a superficial wound.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) There is no credible evidence that the shots were fired\r\n    from the Triple Underpass, ahead of the motorcade, or from any\r\n    other location.\r\n\r\n2. The weight of the evidence indicates that there were three shots\r\nfired.\r\n\r\n3. Although it is not necessary to any essential findings of the\r\nCommission to determine just which shot hit Governor Connally, there\r\nis very persuasive evidence from the experts to indicate that the\r\nsame bullet which pierced the President\u2019s throat also caused Governor\r\nConnally\u2019s wounds. However, Governor Connally\u2019s testimony and certain\r\nother factors have given rise to some difference of opinion as to this\r\nprobability but there is no question in the mind of any member of the\r\nCommission that all the shots which caused the President\u2019s and Governor\r\nConnally\u2019s wounds were fired from the sixth floor window of the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository.\r\n\r\n4. The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor\r\nConnally were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald. This conclusion is based upon\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle from\r\n    which the shots were fired was owned by and in the possession\r\n    of Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Oswald carried this rifle into the Depository Building on\r\n    the morning of November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Oswald, at the time of the assassination, was present at\r\n    the window from which the shots were fired.", "start_char_idx": 102134, "end_char_idx": 106729, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd5f11e5-ad10-430b-a7a9-6d988c88ca8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd5f11e5-ad10-430b-a7a9-6d988c88ca8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9d37a19-34b5-45cd-ac7e-2169a549dfc2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "1c85ba8e1c3da77f8f0aada26ff0659a9e3ee5407800c7e0eb4fbd933b4056a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "564c4b47-7685-442b-9070-483dfcad1fe9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "860860d0753d1c33e84cf5375ccd04737cf9bff8f3e950ba36185d3670fd5037", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, Governor Connally\u2019s testimony and certain\r\nother factors have given rise to some difference of opinion as to this\r\nprobability but there is no question in the mind of any member of the\r\nCommission that all the shots which caused the President\u2019s and Governor\r\nConnally\u2019s wounds were fired from the sixth floor window of the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository.\r\n\r\n4. The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor\r\nConnally were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald. This conclusion is based upon\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle from\r\n    which the shots were fired was owned by and in the possession\r\n    of Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Oswald carried this rifle into the Depository Building on\r\n    the morning of November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Oswald, at the time of the assassination, was present at\r\n    the window from which the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Shortly after the assassination, the Mannlicher-Carcano\r\n    rifle belonging to Oswald was found partially hidden between\r\n    some cartons on the sixth floor and the improvised paper bag\r\n    in which Oswald brought the rifle to the Depository was found\r\n    close by the window from which the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) Based on testimony of the experts and their analysis of\r\n    films of the assassination, the Commission has concluded that a\r\n    rifleman of Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s capabilities could have fired\r\n    the shots from the rifle used in the assassination within the\r\n    elapsed time of the shooting. The Commission has concluded\r\n    further that Oswald possessed the capability with a rifle\r\n    which enabled him to commit the assassination.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) Oswald lied to the police after his arrest concerning\r\n    important substantive matters.\r\n\r\n    (_g_) Oswald had attempted to kill Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n    (Resigned, U.\u00a0S. Army) on April 10, 1963, thereby demonstrating\r\n    his disposition to take human life.\r\n\r\n5. Oswald killed Dallas Police Patrolman J.\u00a0D. Tippit approximately 45\r\nminutes after the assassination. This conclusion upholds the finding\r\nthat Oswald fired the shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded\r\nGovernor Connally and is supported by the following:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Two eyewitnesses saw the Tippit shooting and seven\r\n    eyewitnesses heard the shots and saw the gunman leave the scene\r\n    with revolver in hand. These nine eyewitnesses positively\r\n    identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The cartridge cases found at the scene of the shooting\r\n    were fired from the revolver in the possession of Oswald at the\r\n    time of his arrest to the exclusion of all other weapons.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The revolver in Oswald\u2019s possession at the time of his\r\n    arrest was purchased by and belonged to Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Oswald\u2019s jacket was found along the path of flight taken\r\n    by the gunman as he fled from the scene of the killing.\r\n\r\n6. Within 80 minutes of the assassination and 35 minutes of the Tippit\r\nkilling Oswald resisted arrest at the theatre by attempting to shoot\r\nanother Dallas police officer.\r\n\r\n7. The Commission has reached the following conclusions concerning\r\nOswald\u2019s interrogation and detention by the Dallas police:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Except for the force required to effect his arrest,\r\n    Oswald was not subjected to any physical coercion by any law\r\n    enforcement officials. He was advised that he could not be\r\n    compelled to give any information and that any statements made\r\n    by him might be used against him in court. He was advised of\r\n    his right to counsel. He was given the opportunity to obtain\r\n    counsel of his own choice and was offered legal assistance by\r\n    the Dallas Bar Association, which he rejected at that time.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Newspaper, radio, and television reporters were allowed\r\n    uninhibited access to the area through which Oswald had to\r\n    pass when he was moved from his cell to the interrogation room\r\n    and other sections of the building, thereby subjecting Oswald\r\n    to harassment and creating chaotic conditions which were not\r\n    conducive to orderly interrogation or the protection of the\r\n    rights of the prisoner.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The numerous statements, sometimes erroneous, made to\r\n    the press by various local law enforcement officials, during\r\n    this period of confusion and disorder in the police station,\r\n    would have presented serious obstacles to the obtaining of\r\n    a fair trial for Oswald. To the extent that the information\r\n    was erroneous or misleading, it helped to create doubts,\r\n    speculations, and fears in the mind of the public which might\r\n    otherwise not have arisen.\r\n\r\n8.", "start_char_idx": 105828, "end_char_idx": 110516, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "564c4b47-7685-442b-9070-483dfcad1fe9": {"__data__": {"id_": "564c4b47-7685-442b-9070-483dfcad1fe9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd5f11e5-ad10-430b-a7a9-6d988c88ca8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "2d3acc61d0da3f6a421292b8316a2b09991f66ae30faeba152977a04eb2773c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "04ca790f-5c58-49bd-8737-7108d6a0080f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca9ab61c1d5bc26585b7b5b1b299a8b002f0ef474e6ae48b7b182db4e5e2c108", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(_b_) Newspaper, radio, and television reporters were allowed\r\n    uninhibited access to the area through which Oswald had to\r\n    pass when he was moved from his cell to the interrogation room\r\n    and other sections of the building, thereby subjecting Oswald\r\n    to harassment and creating chaotic conditions which were not\r\n    conducive to orderly interrogation or the protection of the\r\n    rights of the prisoner.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The numerous statements, sometimes erroneous, made to\r\n    the press by various local law enforcement officials, during\r\n    this period of confusion and disorder in the police station,\r\n    would have presented serious obstacles to the obtaining of\r\n    a fair trial for Oswald.

The Commission has reached the following conclusions concerning the\r\nkilling of Oswald by Jack Ruby on November 24, 1963:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Ruby entered the basement of the Dallas Police Department\r\n    shortly after 11:17 a.m. and killed Lee Harvey Oswald at 11:21\r\n    a.m.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Although the evidence on Ruby\u2019s means of entry is not\r\n    conclusive, the weight of the evidence indicates that he walked\r\n    down the ramp leading from Main Street to the basement of the\r\n    police department.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) There is no evidence to support the rumor that Ruby\r\n    may have been assisted by any members of the Dallas Police\r\n    Department in the killing of Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The Dallas Police Department\u2019s decision to transfer\r\n    Oswald to the county jail in full public view was unsound.\r\n    The arrangements made by the police department on Sunday\r\n    morning, only a few hours before the attempted transfer, were\r\n    inadequate. Of critical importance was the fact that news media\r\n    representatives and others were not excluded from the basement\r\n    even after the police were notified of threats to Oswald\u2019s\r\n    life. These deficiencies contributed to the death of Lee Harvey\r\n    Oswald.\r\n\r\n9. The Commission has found no evidence that either Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nor Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign, to\r\nassassinate President Kennedy. The reasons for this conclusion are:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Commission has found no evidence that anyone assisted\r\n    Oswald in planning or carrying out the assassination. In this\r\n    connection it has thoroughly investigated, among other factors,\r\n    the circumstances surrounding the planning of the motorcade\r\n    route through Dallas, the hiring of Oswald by the Texas School\r\n    Book Depository Co. on October 15, 1963, the method by which\r\n    the rifle was brought into the building, the placing of cartons\r\n    of books at the window, Oswald\u2019s escape from the building, and\r\n    the testimony of eyewitnesses to the shooting.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The Commission has found no evidence that Oswald\r\n    was involved with any person or group in a conspiracy to\r\n    assassinate the President, although it has thoroughly\r\n    investigated, in addition to other possible leads, all facets\r\n    of Oswald\u2019s associations, finances, and personal habits,\r\n    particularly during the period following his return from the\r\n    Soviet Union in June 1962.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The Commission has found no evidence to show that\r\n    Oswald was employed, persuaded, or encouraged by any foreign\r\n    government to assassinate President Kennedy or that he was an\r\n    agent of any foreign government, although the Commission has\r\n    reviewed the circumstances surrounding Oswald\u2019s defection to\r\n    the Soviet Union, his life there from October of 1959 to June\r\n    of 1962 so far as it can be reconstructed, his known contacts\r\n    with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and his visits to the\r\n    Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City during his trip to\r\n    Mexico from September 26 to October 3, 1963, and his known\r\n    contacts with the Soviet Embassy in the United States.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The Commission has explored all attempts of Oswald to\r\n    identify himself with various political groups, including the\r\n    Communist Party, U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A., the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,\r\n    and the Socialist Workers Party, and has been unable to find\r\n    any evidence that the contacts which he initiated were related\r\n    to Oswald\u2019s subsequent assassination of the President.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) All of the evidence before the Commission established\r\n    that there was nothing to support the speculation that Oswald\r\n    was an agent, employee, or informant of the FBI, the CIA, or\r\n    any other governmental agency.

In its entire investigation the Commission has found no evidence of\r\nconspiracy, subversion, or disloyalty to the U.\u00a0S. Government by any\r\nFederal, State, or local official.\r\n\r\n11. On the basis of the evidence before the Commission it concludes\r\nthat Oswald acted alone. Therefore, to determine the motives for the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy, one must look to the assassin\r\nhimself. Clues to Oswald\u2019s motives can be found in his family\r\nhistory, his education or lack of it, his acts, his writings, and the\r\nrecollections of those who had close contacts with him throughout\r\nhis life. The Commission has presented with this report all of the\r\nbackground information bearing on motivation which it could discover.\r\nThus, others may study Lee Oswald\u2019s life and arrive at their own\r\nconclusions as to his possible motives.\r\n\r\nThe Commission could not make any definitive determination of Oswald\u2019s\r\nmotives. It has endeavored to isolate factors which contributed to his\r\ncharacter and which might have influenced his decision to assassinate\r\nPresident Kennedy. These factors were:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) His deep-rooted resentment of all authority which was\r\n    expressed in a hostility toward every society in which he lived;\r\n\r\n    (_b_) His inability to enter into meaningful relationships with\r\n    people, and a continuous pattern of rejecting his environment\r\n    in favor of new surroundings;\r\n\r\n    (_c_) His urge to try to find a place in history and despair at\r\n    times over failures in his various undertakings;\r\n\r\n    (_d_) His capacity for violence as evidenced by his attempt to\r\n    kill General Walker;\r\n\r\n    (_e_) His avowed commitment to Marxism and communism, as he\r\n    understood the terms and developed his own interpretation of\r\n    them; this was expressed by his antagonism toward the United\r\n    States, by his defection to the Soviet Union, by his failure\r\n    to be reconciled with life in the United States even after\r\n    his disenchantment with the Soviet Union, and by his efforts,\r\n    though frustrated, to go to Cuba.\r\n\r\nEach of these contributed to his capacity to risk all in cruel and\r\nirresponsible actions.\r\n\r\n12. The Commission recognizes that the varied responsibilities of the\r\nPresident require that he make frequent trips to all parts of the\r\nUnited States and abroad. Consistent with their high responsibilities\r\nPresidents can never be protected from every potential threat. The\r\nSecret Service\u2019s difficulty in meeting its protective responsibility\r\nvaries with the activities and the nature of the occupant of the\r\nOffice of President and his willingness to conform to plans for his\r\nsafety.

In appraising the performance of the Secret Service it should\r\nbe understood that it has to do its work within such limitations.\r\nNevertheless, the Commission believes that recommendations for\r\nimprovements in Presidential protection are compelled by the facts\r\ndisclosed in this investigation.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The complexities of the Presidency have increased so\r\n    rapidly in recent years that the Secret Service has not been\r\n    able to develop or to secure adequate resources of personnel\r\n    and facilities to fulfill its important assignment. This\r\n    situation should be promptly remedied.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The Commission has concluded that the criteria and\r\n    procedures of the Secret Service designed to identify and\r\n    protect against persons considered threats to the president,\r\n    were not adequate prior to the assassination.\r\n\r\n    (1) The Protective Research Section of the Secret Service,\r\n    which is responsible for its preventive work, lacked sufficient\r\n    trained personnel and the mechanical and technical assistance\r\n    needed to fulfill its responsibility.\r\n\r\n    (2) Prior to the assassination the Secret Service\u2019s criteria\r\n    dealt with direct threats against the President. Although the\r\n    Secret Service treated the direct threats against the President\r\n    adequately, it failed to recognize the necessity of identifying\r\n    other potential sources of danger to his security. The Secret\r\n    Service did not develop adequate and specific criteria defining\r\n    those persons or groups who might present a danger to the\r\n    President. In effect, the Secret Service largely relied upon\r\n    other Federal or State agencies to supply the information\r\n    necessary for it to fulfill its preventive responsibilities,\r\n    although it did ask for information about direct threats to the\r\n    President.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The Commission has concluded that there was insufficient\r\n    liaison and coordination of information between the Secret\r\n    Service and other Federal agencies necessarily concerned with\r\n    Presidential protection. Although the FBI, in the normal\r\n    exercise of its responsibility, had secured considerable\r\n    information about Lee Harvey Oswald, it had no official\r\n    responsibility, under the Secret Service criteria existing\r\n    at the time of the President\u2019s trip to Dallas, to refer to\r\n    the Secret Service the information it had about Oswald. The\r\n    Commission has concluded, however, that the FBI took an unduly\r\n    restrictive view of its role in preventive intelligence work\r\n    prior to the assassination. A more carefully coordinated\r\n    treatment of the Oswald case by the FBI might well have\r\n    resulted in bringing Oswald\u2019s activities to the attention of\r\n    the Secret Service.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The Commission has concluded that some of the advance\r\n    preparations in Dallas made by the Secret Service, such as the\r\n    detailed security measures taken at Love Field and the Trade\r\n    Mart, were thorough and well executed. In other respects,\r\n    however, the Commission has concluded that the advance\r\n    preparations for the President\u2019s trip were deficient.\r\n\r\n    (1) Although the Secret Service is compelled to rely to a great\r\n    extent on local law enforcement officials, its procedures at\r\n    the time of the Dallas trip did not call for well-defined\r\n    instructions as to the respective responsibilities of the\r\n    police officials and others assisting in the protection of the\r\n    President.\r\n\r\n    (2) The procedures relied upon by the Secret Service for\r\n    detecting the presence of an assassin located in a building\r\n    along a motorcade route were inadequate. At the time of the\r\n    trip to Dallas, the Secret Service as a matter of practice did\r\n    not investigate, or cause to be checked, any building located\r\n    along the motorcade route to be taken by the President. The\r\n    responsibility for observing windows in these buildings during\r\n    the motorcade was divided between local police personnel\r\n    stationed on the streets to regulate crowds and Secret Service\r\n    agents riding in the motorcade. Based on its investigation the\r\n    Commission has concluded that these arrangements during the\r\n    trip to Dallas were clearly not sufficient.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) The configuration of the Presidential car and the seating\r\n    arrangements of the Secret Service agents in the car did not\r\n    afford the Secret Service agents the opportunity they should\r\n    have had to be of immediate assistance to the President at the\r\n    first sign of danger.", "start_char_idx": 117688, "end_char_idx": 122840, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03729459-4421-4beb-9532-6d737062055e": {"__data__": {"id_": "03729459-4421-4beb-9532-6d737062055e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "70f8df8d-c00a-4aba-b524-d4a05df00acd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "0195dde05779486306bc5fc6f1eabeb9ef60b3cab1725acc7515f60dbb4d5c6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "502898a5-9125-46b7-b9a4-93b10e7382e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4098b37725adab604742c76c572b7e962b4b6abdc3343435dab268b1078c7067", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "At the time of the\r\n    trip to Dallas, the Secret Service as a matter of practice did\r\n    not investigate, or cause to be checked, any building located\r\n    along the motorcade route to be taken by the President.

As a result of studies conducted during the past several\r\nmonths, and in cooperation with this Commission, the Secret Service has\r\nprepared a planning document dated August 27, 1964, which recommends\r\nvarious programs considered necessary by the Service to improve its\r\ntechniques and enlarge its resources. The Commission is encouraged by\r\nthe efforts taken by the Secret Service since the assassination and\r\nsuggests the following recommendations.\r\n\r\n1. A committee of Cabinet members including the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury and the Attorney General, or the National Security Council,\r\nshould be assigned the responsibility of reviewing and overseeing the\r\nprotective activities of the Secret Service and the other Federal\r\nagencies that assist in safeguarding the President. Once given this\r\nresponsibility, such a committee would insure that the maximum\r\nresources of the Federal Government are fully engaged in the task of\r\nprotecting the President, and would provide guidance in defining the\r\ngeneral nature of domestic and foreign dangers to Presidential security.\r\n\r\n2. Suggestions have been advanced to the Commission for the transfer\r\nof all or parts of the Presidential protective responsibilities of\r\nthe Secret Service to some other department or agency. The Commission\r\nbelieves that if there is to be any determination of whether or not to\r\nrelocate these responsibilities and functions, it ought to be made by\r\nthe Executive and the Congress, perhaps upon recommendations based on\r\nstudies by the previously suggested committee.\r\n\r\n3. Meanwhile, in order to improve daily supervision of the Secret\r\nService within the Department of the Treasury, the Commission\r\nrecommends that the Secretary of the Treasury appoint a special\r\nassistant with the responsibility of supervising the Secret Service.\r\nThis special assistant should have sufficient stature and experience in\r\nlaw enforcement, intelligence, and allied fields to provide effective\r\ncontinuing supervision, and to keep the Secretary fully informed\r\nregarding the performance of the Secret Service. One of the initial\r\nassignments of this special assistant should be the supervision of the\r\ncurrent effort by the Secret Service to revise and modernize its basic\r\noperating procedures.\r\n\r\n4. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service completely\r\noverhaul its facilities devoted to the advance detection of potential\r\nthreats against the President. The Commission suggests the following\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Secret Service should develop as quickly as possible\r\n    more useful and precise criteria defining those potential\r\n    threats to the President which should be brought to its\r\n    attention by other agencies. The criteria should, among other\r\n    additions, provide for prompt notice to the Secret Service of\r\n    all returned defectors.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The Secret Service should expedite its current plans to\r\n    utilize the most efficient data-processing techniques.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Once the Secret Service has formulated new criteria\r\n    delineating the information it desires, it should enter into\r\n    agreements with each Federal agency to insure its receipt of\r\n    such information.\r\n\r\n5. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service improve the\r\nprotective measures followed in the planning, and conducting of\r\nPresidential motorcades.

The narrative of these events\r\nis based largely on the recollections of the participants, although\r\nin many instances documentary or other evidence has also been used by\r\nthe Commission. Beginning with the advance plans and Secret Service\r\npreparations for the trip, this chapter reviews the motorcade through\r\nDallas, the fleeting moments of the assassination, the activities at\r\nParkland Memorial Hospital, and the return of the Presidential party to\r\nWashington. An evaluation of the procedures employed to safeguard the\r\nPresident, with recommendations for improving these procedures, appears\r\nin chapter VIII of the report.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNING THE TEXAS TRIP\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy\u2019s visit to Texas in November 1963 had been under\r\nconsideration for almost a year before it occurred.

When the trip was planned for only 1 day, Governor Connally\r\nhad opposed the motorcade because there was not enough time.[C2-13]\r\nThe Governor stated, however, that \u201conce we got San Antonio moved\r\nfrom Friday to Thursday afternoon, where that was his initial stop\r\nin Texas, then we had the time, and I withdrew my objections to\r\na motorcade.\u201d[C2-14] According to O\u2019Donnell, \u201cwe had a motorcade\r\nwherever we went,\u201d particularly in large cities where the purpose was\r\nto let the President be seen by as many people as possible.[C2-15]\r\nIn his experience, \u201cit would be automatic\u201d for the Secret Service\r\nto arrange a route which would, within the time allotted, bring the\r\nPresident \u201cthrough an area which exposes him to the greatest number of\r\npeople.\u201d[C2-16]\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DALLAS TRIP\r\n\r\nAdvance preparations for President Kennedy\u2019s visit to Dallas were\r\nprimarily the responsibility of two Secret Service agents: Special\r\nAgent Winston G. Lawson, a member of the White House detail who acted\r\nas the advance agent, and Forrest V. Sorrels, special agent in charge\r\nof the Dallas office.[C2-17] Both agents were advised of the trip on\r\nNovember 4.[C2-18] Lawson received a tentative schedule of the Texas\r\ntrip on November 8 from Roy H. Kellerman, assistant special agent in\r\ncharge of the White House detail, who was the Secret Service official\r\nresponsible for the entire Texas journey.[C2-19] As advance agent\r\nworking closely with Sorrels, Lawson had responsibility for arranging\r\nthe timetable for the President\u2019s visit to Dallas and coordinating\r\nlocal activities with the White House staff, the organizations directly\r\nconcerned with the visit, and local law enforcement officials.[C2-20]\r\nLawson\u2019s most important responsibilities were to take preventive\r\naction against anyone in Dallas considered a threat to the President,\r\nto select the luncheon site and motorcade route, and to plan security\r\nmeasures for the luncheon and the motorcade.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventive Intelligence Activities\r\n\r\nThe Protective Research Section (PRS) of the Secret Service maintains\r\nrecords of people who have threatened the President or so conducted\r\nthemselves as to be deemed a potential danger to him.", "start_char_idx": 130336, "end_char_idx": 134630, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e62bcbf-6de8-4207-a992-468e14725f05": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e62bcbf-6de8-4207-a992-468e14725f05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6c847d7-9946-4cb3-94e1-211536230555", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "642dff1b4712f563d32f637d3d805f5d0a5384d5b10131a4c7d8e47ebe3d11f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c9bf6c3-f5b7-4f5d-ae53-d8ae7e4dddac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f915d6d066f41a8998f931d72639cfde52528cc2a5ddfc37c3402b226c272fb6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C2-19] As advance agent\r\nworking closely with Sorrels, Lawson had responsibility for arranging\r\nthe timetable for the President\u2019s visit to Dallas and coordinating\r\nlocal activities with the White House staff, the organizations directly\r\nconcerned with the visit, and local law enforcement officials.[C2-20]\r\nLawson\u2019s most important responsibilities were to take preventive\r\naction against anyone in Dallas considered a threat to the President,\r\nto select the luncheon site and motorcade route, and to plan security\r\nmeasures for the luncheon and the motorcade.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventive Intelligence Activities\r\n\r\nThe Protective Research Section (PRS) of the Secret Service maintains\r\nrecords of people who have threatened the President or so conducted\r\nthemselves as to be deemed a potential danger to him. On November 8,\r\n1963, after undertaking the responsibility for advance preparations\r\nfor the visit to Dallas, Agent Lawson went to the PRS offices in\r\nWashington. A check of the geographic indexes there revealed no listing\r\nfor any individual deemed to be a potential danger to the President\r\nin the territory of the Secret Service regional office which includes\r\nDallas and Fort Worth.[C2-21]\r\n\r\nTo supplement the PRS files, the Secret Service depends largely on\r\nlocal police departments and local offices of other Federal agencies\r\nwhich advise it of potential threats immediately before the visit\r\nof the President to their community. Upon his arrival in Dallas on\r\nNovember 12 Lawson conferred with the local police and the local\r\noffice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation about potential dangers\r\nto the President. Although there was no mention in PRS files of the\r\ndemonstration in Dallas against Ambassador Adlai Stevenson on October\r\n24, 1963, Lawson inquired about the incident and obtained through the\r\nlocal police photographs of some of the persons involved.[C2-22] On\r\nNovember 22 a Secret Service agent stood at the entrance to the Trade\r\nMart, where the President was scheduled to speak, with copies of these\r\nphotographs. Dallas detectives in the lobby of the Trade Mart and in\r\nthe luncheon area also had copies of these photographs. A number of\r\npeople who resembled some of those in the photographs were placed under\r\nsurveillance at the Trade Mart.[C2-23]\r\n\r\nThe FBI office in Dallas gave the local Secret Service representatives\r\nthe name of a possibly dangerous individual in the Dallas area who was\r\ninvestigated. It also advised the Secret Service of the circulation on\r\nNovember 21 of a handbill sharply critical of President Kennedy,[C2-24]\r\ndiscussed in chapter VI of this report. Shortly before, the Dallas\r\npolice had reported to the Secret Service that the handbill had\r\nappeared on the streets of Dallas. Neither the Dallas police nor the\r\nFBI had yet learned the source of the handbill.[C2-25] No one else was\r\nidentified to the Secret Service through local inquiry as potentially\r\ndangerous, nor did PRS develop any additional information between\r\nNovember 12, when Lawson left Washington, and November 22. The adequacy\r\nof the intelligence system maintained by the Secret Service at the time\r\nof the assassination, including a detailed description of the available\r\ndata on Lee Harvey Oswald and the reasons why his name had not been\r\nfurnished to the Secret Service, is discussed in chapter VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Luncheon Site\r\n\r\nAn important purpose of the President\u2019s visit to Dallas was to speak at\r\na luncheon given by business and civic leaders. The White House staff\r\ninformed the Secret Service that the President would arrive and depart\r\nfrom Dallas\u2019 Love Field; that a motorcade through the downtown area of\r\nDallas to the luncheon site should be arranged; and that following the\r\nluncheon the President would return to the airport by the most direct\r\nroute. Accordingly, it was important to determine the luncheon site as\r\nquickly as possible, so that security could be established at the site\r\nand the motorcade route selected.\r\n\r\nOn November 4, Gerald A. Behn, agent in charge of the White House\r\ndetail, asked Sorrels to examine three potential sites for the\r\nluncheon.[C2-26] One building, Market Hall, was unavailable for\r\nNovember 22. The second, the Women\u2019s Building at the State Fair\r\nGrounds, was a one-story building with few entrances and easy to make\r\nsecure, but it lacked necessary food-handling facilities and had\r\ncertain unattractive features, including a low ceiling with exposed\r\nconduits and beams. The third possibility, the Trade Mart, a handsome\r\nnew building with all the necessary facilities, presented security\r\nproblems.

On November 4,\r\nSorrels told Behn he believed security difficulties at the Trade Mart\r\ncould be overcome by special precautions.[C2-27] Lawson also evaluated\r\nthe security hazards at the Trade Mart on November 13.[C2-28] Kenneth\r\nO\u2019Donnell made the final decision to hold the luncheon at the Trade\r\nMart; Behn so notified Lawson on November 14.[C2-29]\r\n\r\nOnce the Trade Mart had been selected, Sorrels and Lawson worked out\r\ndetailed arrangements for security at the building. In addition to the\r\npreventive measures already mentioned, they provided for controlling\r\naccess to the building, closing off and policing areas around it,\r\nsecuring the roof and insuring the presence of numerous police\r\nofficers inside and around the building. Ultimately more than 200 law\r\nenforcement officers, mainly Dallas police but including 8 Secret\r\nService agents, were deployed in and around the Trade Mart.[C2-30]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Motorcade Route\r\n\r\nOn November 8, when Lawson was briefed on the itinerary for the trip to\r\nDallas, he was told that 45 minutes had been allotted for a motorcade\r\nprocession from Love Field to the luncheon site.[C2-31] Lawson was not\r\nspecifically instructed to select the parade route, but he understood\r\nthat this was one of his functions.[C2-32] Even before the Trade Mart\r\nhad been definitely selected, Lawson and Sorrels began to consider the\r\nbest motorcade route from Love Field to the Trade Mart. On November 14,\r\nLawson and Sorrels attended a meeting at Love Field and on their return\r\nto Dallas drove over the route which Sorrels believed best suited for\r\nthe proposed motorcade.[C2-33] This route, eventually selected for the\r\nmotorcade from the airport to the Trade Mart, measured 10 miles and\r\ncould be driven easily within the allotted 45 minutes.[C2-34] From Love\r\nField the route passed through a portion of suburban Dallas, through\r\nthe downtown area along Main Street and then to the Trade Mart via\r\nStemmons Freeway. For the President\u2019s return to Love Field following\r\nthe luncheon, the agents selected the most direct route, which was\r\napproximately 4 miles.[C2-35]\r\n\r\nAfter the selection of the Trade Mart as the luncheon site, Lawson\r\nand Sorrels met with Dallas Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry, Assistant\r\nChief Charles Batchelor, Deputy Chief N.\u00a0T. Fisher, and several other\r\ncommand officers to discuss details of the motorcade and possible\r\nroutes.[C2-36] The route was further reviewed by Lawson and Sorrels\r\nwith Assistant Chief Batchelor and members of the local host committee\r\non November 15. The police officials agreed that the route recommended\r\nby Sorrels was the proper one and did not express a belief that any\r\nother route might be better.[C2-37] On November 18, Sorrels and Lawson\r\ndrove over the selected route with Batchelor and other police officers,\r\nverifying that it could be traversed within 45 minutes. Representatives\r\nof the local host committee and the White House staff were advised by\r\nthe Secret Service of the actual route on the afternoon of November\r\n18.[C2-38]\r\n\r\nThe route impressed the agents as a natural and desirable one. Sorrels,\r\nwho had participated in Presidential protection assignments in Dallas\r\nsince a visit by President Franklin D.

Sorrels,\r\nwho had participated in Presidential protection assignments in Dallas\r\nsince a visit by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936,[C2-39]\r\ntestified that the traditional parade route in Dallas was along Main\r\nStreet, since the tall buildings along the street gave more people an\r\nopportunity to participate.[C2-40] The route chosen from the airport\r\nto Main Street was the normal one, except where Harwood Street was\r\nselected as the means of access to Main Street in preference to a short\r\nstretch of the Central Expressway, which presented a minor safety\r\nhazard and could not accommodate spectators as conveniently as Harwood\r\nStreet.[C2-41] According to Lawson, the chosen route seemed to be the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n    It afforded us wide streets most of the way, because of the\r\n    buses that were in the motorcade. It afforded us a chance to\r\n    have alternative routes if something happened on the motorcade\r\n    route. It was the type of suburban area a good part of the way\r\n    where the crowds would be able to be controlled for a great\r\n    distance, and we figured that the largest crowds would be\r\n    downtown, which they were, and that the wide streets that we\r\n    would use downtown would be of sufficient width to keep the\r\n    public out of our way.[C2-42]\r\n\r\nElm Street, parallel to Main Street and one block north, was not used\r\nfor the main portion of the downtown part of the motorcade because Main\r\nStreet offered better vantage points for spectators.\r\n\r\nTo reach the Trade Mart from Main Street the agents decided to use\r\nthe Stemmons Freeway (Route No. 77), the most direct route. The only\r\npractical way for westbound traffic on Main Street to reach the\r\nnorthbound lanes of the Stemmons Freeway is via Elm Street, which\r\nRoute No. 77 traffic is instructed to follow in this part of the\r\ncity. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2113, p. 34.) Elm Street was to be\r\nreached from Main by turning right at Houston, going one block north\r\nand then turning left onto Elm. On this last portion of the journey,\r\nonly 5 minutes from the Trade Mart, the President\u2019s motorcade would\r\npass the Texas School Book Depository Building on the northwest corner\r\nof Houston and Elm Streets. The building overlooks Dealey Plaza,\r\nan attractively landscaped triangle of 3 acres. (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 876, p. 33.) From Houston Street, which forms the base\r\nof the triangle, three streets--Commerce, Main, and Elm--trisect\r\nthe plaza, converging at the apex of the triangle to form a triple\r\nunderpass beneath a multiple railroad bridge almost 500 feet from\r\nHouston Street.[C2-43] Elm Street, the northernmost of the three,\r\nafter intersecting Houston curves in a southwesterly arc through the\r\nunderpass and leads into an access road, which branches off to the\r\nright and is used by traffic going to the Stemmons Freeway and the\r\nDallas-Fort Worth Turnpike.

To\r\ncreate this traffic pattern, a concrete barrier between Main and Elm\r\nStreets presents an obstacle to a right turn from Main across Elm to\r\nthe access road to Stemmons Freeway and the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike.\r\nThis concrete barrier extends far enough beyond the access road to\r\nmake it impracticable for vehicles to turn right from Main directly to\r\nthe access road. A sign located on this barrier instructs Main Street\r\ntraffic not to make any turns.[C2-45] (See Commission Exhibits Nos.\r\n2114-2116, pp. 35-37.) In conformity with these arrangements, traffic\r\nproceeding west on Main is directed to turn right at Houston in order\r\nto reach the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike, which has the same access road\r\nfrom Elm Street as does the Stemmons Freeway.[C2-46] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 2967, p. 38.)\r\n\r\nThe planning for the motorcade also included advance preparations for\r\nsecurity arrangements along the route. Sorrels and Lawson reviewed the\r\nroute in cooperation with Assistant Chief Batchelor and other Dallas\r\npolice officials who took notes on the requirements for controlling the\r\ncrowds and traffic, watching the overpasses, and providing motorcycle\r\nescort.[C2-47] To control traffic, arrangements were made for the\r\ndeployment of foot patrolmen and motorcycle police at various positions\r\nalong the route.[C2-48] Police were assigned to each overpass on the\r\nroute and instructed to keep them clear of unauthorized persons.[C2-49]\r\nNo arrangements were made for police or building custodians to inspect\r\nbuildings along the motorcade route since the Secret Service did\r\nnot normally request or make such a check.[C2-50] Under standard\r\nprocedures, the responsibility for watching the windows of buildings\r\nwas shared by local police stationed along the route and Secret Service\r\nagents riding in the motorcade.[C2-51]\r\n\r\nAs the date for the President\u2019s visit approached, the two Dallas\r\nnewspapers carried several reports of his motorcade route.

The\r\nselection of the Trade Mart as the possible site for the luncheon first\r\nappeared in the Dallas Times-Herald on November 15, 1963.[C2-52] The\r\nfollowing day, the newspaper reported that the Presidential party\r\n\u201capparently will loop through the downtown area, probably on Main\r\nStreet, en route from Dallas Love Field\u201d on its way to the Trade\r\nMart.[C2-53] On November 19, the Times-Herald afternoon paper detailed\r\nthe precise route:\r\n\r\n    From the airport, the President\u2019s party will proceed to\r\n    Mockingbird Lane to Lemmon and then to Turtle Creek, turning\r\n    south to Cedar Springs.\r\n\r\n    The motorcade will then pass through downtown on Harwood and\r\n    then west on Main, turning back to Elm at Houston and then out\r\n    Stemmons Freeway to the Trade Mart.[C2-54]\r\n\r\nAlso on November 19, the Morning News reported that the President\u2019s\r\nmotorcade would travel from Love Field along specified streets, then\r\n\u201cHarwood to Main, Main to Houston, Houston to Elm, Elm under the Triple\r\nUnderpass to Stemmons Freeway, and on to the Trade Mart.\u201d[C2-55] On\r\nNovember 20 a front page story reported that the streets on which\r\nthe Presidential motorcade would travel included \u201cMain and Stemmons\r\nFreeway.\u201d[C2-56] On the morning of the President\u2019s arrival, the Morning\r\nNews noted that the motorcade would travel through downtown Dallas onto\r\nthe Stemmons Freeway, and reported that \u201cthe motorcade will move slowly\r\nso that crowds can \u2018get a good view\u2019 of President Kennedy and his\r\nwife.\u201d[C2-57]\r\n\r\n\r\nDALLAS BEFORE THE VISIT\r\n\r\nThe President\u2019s intention to pay a visit to Texas in the fall of 1963\r\naroused interest throughout the State. The two Dallas newspapers\r\nprovided their readers with a steady stream of information and\r\nspeculation about the trip, beginning on September 13, when the\r\nTimes-Herald announced in a front page article that President Kennedy\r\nwas planning a brief 1-day tour of four Texas cities--Dallas, Fort\r\nWorth, San Antonio, and Houston.[C2-58] Both Dallas papers cited White\r\nHouse sources on September 26 as confirming the President\u2019s intention\r\nto visit Texas on November 21 and 22, with Dallas scheduled as one of\r\nthe stops.[C2-59]\r\n\r\nArticles, editorials, and letters to the editor in the Dallas Morning\r\nNews and the Dallas Times-Herald after September 13 reflected the\r\nfeeling in the community toward the forthcoming Presidential visit.\r\nAlthough there were critical editorials and letters to the editors, the\r\nnews stories reflected the desire of Dallas officials to welcome the\r\nPresident with dignity and courtesy. An editorial in the Times-Herald\r\nof September 17 called on the people of Dallas to be \u201ccongenial\r\nhosts\u201d even though \u201cDallas didn\u2019t vote for Mr. Kennedy in 1960, may\r\nnot endorse him in \u201964.\u201d[C2-60] On October 3 the Dallas Morning News\r\nquoted U.S. Representative Joe Pool\u2019s hope that President Kennedy would\r\nreceive a \u201cgood welcome\u201d and would not face demonstrations like those\r\nencountered by Vice President Johnson during the 1960 campaign.[C2-61]\r\n\r\nIncreased concern about the President\u2019s visit was aroused by the\r\nincident involving the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai\r\nE.

Stevenson. On the evening of October 24, 1963, after addressing\r\na meeting in Dallas, Stevenson was jeered, jostled, and spat upon\r\nby hostile demonstrators outside the Dallas Memorial Auditorium\r\nTheater.[C2-62] The local, national, and international reaction to\r\nthis incident evoked from Dallas officials and newspapers strong\r\ncondemnations of the demonstrators. Mayor Earle Cabell called on the\r\ncity to redeem itself during President Kennedy\u2019s visit.[C2-63] He\r\nasserted that Dallas had shed its reputation of the twenties as the\r\n\u201cSouthwest hate capital of Dixie.\u201d[C2-64] On October 26 the press\r\nreported Chief of Police Curry\u2019s plans to call in 100 extra off-duty\r\nofficers to help protect President Kennedy.[C2-65] Any thought that\r\nthe President might cancel his visit to Dallas was ended when Governor\r\nConnally confirmed on November 8 that the President would come to Texas\r\non November 21-22, and that he would visit San Antonio, Houston, Fort\r\nWorth, Dallas, and Austin.[C2-66]\r\n\r\nDuring November the Dallas papers reported frequently on the plans\r\nfor protecting the President, stressing the thoroughness of the\r\npreparations. They conveyed the pleas of Dallas leaders that citizens\r\nnot demonstrate or create disturbances during the President\u2019s visit.\r\nOn November 18 the Dallas City Council adopted a new city ordinance\r\nprohibiting interference with attendance at lawful assemblies.[C2-67]\r\nTwo days before the President\u2019s arrival Chief Curry warned that the\r\nDallas police would not permit improper conduct during the President\u2019s\r\nvisit.[C2-68]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on November 17 the president of the Dallas Chamber of\r\nCommerce referred to the city\u2019s reputation for being the friendliest\r\ntown in America and asserted that citizens would \u201cgreet the President\r\nof the United States with the warmth and pride that keep the Dallas\r\nspirit famous the world over.\u201d[C2-69] Two days later, a local\r\nRepublican leader called for a \u201ccivilized nonpartisan\u201d welcome for\r\nPresident Kennedy, stating that \u201cin many respects Dallas County has\r\nisolated itself from the main stream of life in the world in this\r\ndecade.\u201d[C2-70]\r\n\r\nAnother reaction to the impending visit--hostile to the President--came\r\nto a head shortly before his arrival. On November 21 there appeared\r\non the streets of Dallas the anonymous handbill mentioned above. It\r\nwas fashioned after the \u201cwanted\u201d circulars issued by law enforcement\r\nagencies. Beneath two photographs of President Kennedy, one fullface\r\nand one profile, appeared the caption, \u201cWanted for Treason,\u201d followed\r\nby a scurrilous bill of particulars that constituted a vilification of\r\nthe President.[C2-71] And on the morning of the President\u2019s arrival,\r\nthere appeared in the Morning News a full page, black-bordered\r\nadvertisement headed \u201cWelcome Mr. Kennedy to Dallas,\u201d sponsored by\r\nthe American Factfinding Committee, which the sponsor later testified\r\nwas an ad hoc committee \u201cformed strictly for the purpose of having\r\na name to put in the paper.\u201d[C2-72] The \u201cwelcome\u201d consisted of a\r\nseries of statements and questions critical of the President and his\r\nadministration.[C2-73] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1031, p. 294.)\r\n\r\n\r\nVISITS TO OTHER TEXAS CITIES\r\n\r\nThe trip to Texas began with the departure of President and Mrs.\r\nKennedy from the White House by helicopter at 10:45 a.m., e.s.t., on\r\nNovember 21, 1963, for Andrews AFB.

Special Agent Rufus W. Youngblood observed that the large\r\nelectric sign clock atop the Texas School Book Depository Building\r\nshowed the numerals \u201c12:30\u201d as the Vice-Presidential automobile\r\nproceeded north on Houston Street, a few seconds before the shots were\r\nfired.[C2-141] Just prior to the shooting, David F. Powers, riding in\r\nthe Secret Service followup car, remarked to Kenneth O\u2019Donnell that\r\nit was 12:30 p.m., the time they were due at the Trade Mart.[C2-142]\r\nSeconds after the shooting, Roy Kellerman, riding in the front seat\r\nof the Presidential limousine, looked at his watch and said \u201c12:30\u201d\r\nto the driver, Special Agent Greer.[C2-143] The Dallas police radio\r\nlog reflects that Chief of Police Curry reported the shooting of the\r\nPresident and issued his initial orders at 12:30 p.m.[C2-144]\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeed of the Limousine\r\n\r\nWilliam Greer, operator of the Presidential limousine, estimated\r\nthe car\u2019s speed at the time of the first shot as 12 to 15 miles per\r\nhour.[C2-145] Other witnesses in the motorcade estimated the speed\r\nof the President\u2019s limousine from 7 to 22 miles per hour.[C2-146] A\r\nmore precise determination has been made from motion pictures taken\r\non the scene by an amateur photographer, Abraham Zapruder. Based on\r\nthese films, the speed of the President\u2019s automobile is computed at an\r\naverage speed of 11.2 miles per hour. The car maintained this average\r\nspeed over a distance of approximately 136 feet immediately preceding\r\nthe shot which struck the President in the head. While the car traveled\r\nthis distance, the Zapruder camera ran 152 frames. Since the camera\r\noperates at a speed of 18.3 frames per second, it was calculated that\r\nthe car required 8.3 seconds to cover the 136 feet. This represents a\r\nspeed of 11.2 miles per hour.[C2-147]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Presidential Limousine\r\n\r\nMrs. John F. Kennedy, on the left of the rear seat of the limousine,\r\nlooked toward her left and waved to the crowds along the route. Soon\r\nafter the motorcade turned onto Elm Street, she heard a sound similar\r\nto a motorcycle noise and a cry from Governor Connally, which caused\r\nher to look to her right. On turning she saw a quizzical look on her\r\nhusband\u2019s face as he raised his left hand to his throat. Mrs. Kennedy\r\nthen heard a second shot and saw the President\u2019s skull torn open under\r\nthe impact of the bullet. As she cradled her mortally wounded husband,\r\nMrs. Kennedy cried, \u201cOh, my God, they have shot my husband. I love you,\r\nJack.\u201d[C2-148]\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally testified that he recognized the first noise as a\r\nrifle shot and the thought immediately crossed his mind that it was\r\nan assassination attempt. From his position in the right jump seat\r\nimmediately in front of the President, he instinctively turned to his\r\nright because the shot appeared to come from over his right shoulder.\r\nUnable to see the President as he turned to the right, the Governor\r\nstarted to look back over his left shoulder, but he never completed the\r\nturn because he felt something strike him in the back.[C2-149] In his\r\ntestimony before the Commission, Governor Connally was certain that he\r\nwas hit by the second shot, which he stated he did not hear.[C2-150]\r\n\r\nMrs. Connally, too, heard a frightening noise from her right.", "start_char_idx": 168499, "end_char_idx": 172571, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edacf22a-b88b-4b3f-978b-653bdbccad85": {"__data__": {"id_": "edacf22a-b88b-4b3f-978b-653bdbccad85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "35d8e054-bcf6-4bf7-963f-7f802b7b31f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "9f7a0d5c91edaf2af1612561dff82034f6c70e9ce063d4e72a2b24e4df2621c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1567dcf6-69b1-4f2c-91ec-fe79daed2e1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "74fdcc5b7a1b45c071f99807808e5bd0f0b47c4c9849dd64dcf0277d8fcdb86a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Kennedy cried, \u201cOh, my God, they have shot my husband.

Turning to his right in the direction of the\r\nnoise, Kellerman heard the President say \u201cMy God, I am hit,\u201d and saw\r\nboth of the President\u2019s hands move up toward his neck. As he told the\r\ndriver, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here; we are hit,\u201d Kellerman grabbed his\r\nmicrophone and radioed ahead to the lead car, \u201cWe are hit. Get us to\r\nthe hospital immediately.\u201d[C2-152]\r\n\r\nThe driver, William Greer, heard a noise which he took to be a backfire\r\nfrom one of the motorcycles flanking the Presidential car. When he\r\nheard the same noise again, Greer glanced over his shoulder and saw\r\nGovernor Connally fall. At the sound of the second shot he realized\r\nthat something was wrong, and he pressed down on the accelerator as\r\nKellerman said, \u201cGet out of here fast.\u201d[C2-153] As he issued his\r\ninstructions to Greer and to the lead car, Kellerman heard a \u201cflurry\r\nof shots\u201d within 5 seconds of the first noise. According to Kellerman,\r\nMrs. Kennedy then cried out: \u201cWhat are they doing to you?\u201d Looking back\r\nfrom the front seat, Kellerman saw Governor Connally in his wife\u2019s\r\nlap and Special Agent Clinton J. Hill lying across the trunk of the\r\ncar.[C2-154]\r\n\r\nMrs. Connally heard a second shot fired and pulled her husband down\r\ninto her lap.[C2-155] Observing his blood-covered chest as he was\r\npulled into his wife\u2019s lap, Governor Connally believed himself mortally\r\nwounded. He cried out, \u201cOh, no, no, no. My God, they are going to kill\r\nus all.\u201d[C2-156] At first Mrs. Connally thought that her husband had\r\nbeen killed, but then she noticed an almost imperceptible movement\r\nand knew that he was still alive. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Be\r\nstill.\u201d[C2-157] The Governor was lying with his head on his wife\u2019s lap\r\nwhen he heard a shot hit the President.[C2-158] At that point, both\r\nGovernor and Mrs. Connally observed brain tissue splattered over the\r\ninterior of the car.[C2-159] According to Governor and Mrs. Connally,\r\nit was after this shot that Kellerman issued his emergency instructions\r\nand the car accelerated.[C2-160]\r\n\r\n\r\nReaction by Secret Service Agents\r\n\r\nFrom the left front running board of the President\u2019s followup car,\r\nSpecial Agent Hill was scanning the few people standing on the south\r\nside of Elm Street after the motorcade had turned off Houston Street.\r\nHe estimated that the motorcade had slowed down to approximately 9 or\r\n10 miles per hour on the turn at the intersection of Houston and Elm\r\nStreets and then proceeded at a rate of 12 to 15 miles per hour with\r\nthe followup car trailing the President\u2019s automobile by approximately\r\n5 feet.[C2-161] Hill heard a noise, which seemed to be a firecracker,\r\ncoming from his right rear.", "start_char_idx": 171719, "end_char_idx": 175530, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1567dcf6-69b1-4f2c-91ec-fe79daed2e1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1567dcf6-69b1-4f2c-91ec-fe79daed2e1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "edacf22a-b88b-4b3f-978b-653bdbccad85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "95fbd3e96a1b421c28e4c3081b3b0c64610a0eed2f647ad5a1ac2f7b6e0f2a98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0af0d52a-dfe3-4c23-bc83-3ff93b6f056a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c7430ea735b93bfca017d5046bcbf4eed1a78393578f8fd26ae2251d95603f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Connally observed brain tissue splattered over the\r\ninterior of the car.[C2-159] According to Governor and Mrs. Connally,\r\nit was after this shot that Kellerman issued his emergency instructions\r\nand the car accelerated.[C2-160]\r\n\r\n\r\nReaction by Secret Service Agents\r\n\r\nFrom the left front running board of the President\u2019s followup car,\r\nSpecial Agent Hill was scanning the few people standing on the south\r\nside of Elm Street after the motorcade had turned off Houston Street.\r\nHe estimated that the motorcade had slowed down to approximately 9 or\r\n10 miles per hour on the turn at the intersection of Houston and Elm\r\nStreets and then proceeded at a rate of 12 to 15 miles per hour with\r\nthe followup car trailing the President\u2019s automobile by approximately\r\n5 feet.[C2-161] Hill heard a noise, which seemed to be a firecracker,\r\ncoming from his right rear.

Carrico, a resident in general surgery.[C2-192] Dr. Carrico\r\nwas in the emergency area, examining another patient, when he was\r\nnotified that President Kennedy was en route to the hospital.[C2-193]\r\nApproximately 2 minutes later, Dr. Carrico saw the President on his\r\nback, being wheeled into the emergency area.[C2-194] He noted that\r\nthe President was blue-white or ashen in color; had slow, spasmodic,\r\nagonal respiration without any coordination; made no voluntary\r\nmovements; had his eyes open with the pupils dilated without any\r\nreaction to light; evidenced no palpable pulse; and had a few chest\r\nsounds which were thought to be heart beats.[C2-195] On the basis of\r\nthese findings, Dr. Carrico concluded that President Kennedy was still\r\nalive.[C2-196]\r\n\r\nDr. Carrico noted two wounds: a small bullet wound in the front\r\nlower neck, and an extensive wound in the President\u2019s head where\r\na sizable portion of the skull was missing.[C2-197] He observed\r\nshredded brain tissue and \u201cconsiderable slow oozing\u201d from the latter\r\nwound, followed by \u201cmore profuse bleeding\u201d after some circulation\r\nwas established.[C2-198] Dr. Carrico felt the President\u2019s back and\r\ndetermined that there was no large wound there which would be an\r\nimmediate threat to life.[C2-199] Observing the serious problems\r\npresented by the head wound and inadequate respiration, Dr. Carrico\r\ndirected his attention to improving the President\u2019s breathing.", "start_char_idx": 181615, "end_char_idx": 185547, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c6d8d6a-be58-4c45-bc97-420f4ce26d49": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c6d8d6a-be58-4c45-bc97-420f4ce26d49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ddca891-59c9-45b6-83a7-8503a683ebf7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "7aede7de6838ebc366e41526b7d6a85dd3cb1b4427d59db2c8d740e48c687b7d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4daed833-dfe3-4064-84ee-a2bb0c631c7d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "34414c0e97bffe17656920282c78d8b8ebcaa98863c540d67c534ba9356151a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C2-195] On the basis of\r\nthese findings, Dr. Carrico concluded that President Kennedy was still\r\nalive.[C2-196]\r\n\r\nDr. Carrico noted two wounds: a small bullet wound in the front\r\nlower neck, and an extensive wound in the President\u2019s head where\r\na sizable portion of the skull was missing.[C2-197] He observed\r\nshredded brain tissue and \u201cconsiderable slow oozing\u201d from the latter\r\nwound, followed by \u201cmore profuse bleeding\u201d after some circulation\r\nwas established.[C2-198] Dr. Carrico felt the President\u2019s back and\r\ndetermined that there was no large wound there which would be an\r\nimmediate threat to life.[C2-199] Observing the serious problems\r\npresented by the head wound and inadequate respiration, Dr. Carrico\r\ndirected his attention to improving the President\u2019s breathing.[C2-200]\r\nHe noted contusions, hematoma to the right of the larynx, which was\r\ndeviated slightly to the left, and also ragged tissue which indicated\r\na tracheal injury.[C2-201] Dr. Carrico inserted a cuffed endotracheal\r\ntube past the injury, inflated the cuff, and connected it to a Bennett\r\nmachine to assist in respiration.[C2-202]\r\n\r\nAt that point, direction of the President\u2019s treatment was undertaken by\r\nDr. Malcolm O. Perry, who arrived at trauma room 1 a few moments after\r\nthe President.[C2-203] Dr. Perry noted the President\u2019s back brace as\r\nhe felt for a femoral pulse, which he did not find.[C2-204] Observing\r\nthat an effective airway had to be established if treatment was to be\r\neffective, Dr. Perry performed a tracheotomy, which required 3 to 5\r\nminutes.[C2-205] While Dr. Perry was performing the tracheotomy, Drs.\r\nCarrico and Ronald Jones made cutdowns on the President\u2019s right leg and\r\nleft arm, respectively, to infuse blood and fluids into the circulatory\r\nsystem.[C2-206] Dr. Carrico treated the President\u2019s known adrenal\r\ninsufficiency by administering hydrocortisone.[C2-207] Dr. Robert\r\nN. McClelland entered at that point and assisted Dr. Perry with the\r\ntracheotomy.[C2-208]\r\n\r\nDr. Fouad Bashour, chief of cardiology, Dr. M.\u00a0T. Jenkins, chief\r\nof anesthesiology, and Dr. A.\u00a0H. Giesecke, Jr., then joined in the\r\neffort to revive the President.[C2-209] When Dr. Perry noted free air\r\nand blood in the President\u2019s chest cavity, he asked that chest tubes\r\nbe inserted to allow for drainage of blood and air. Drs. Paul C.\r\nPeters and Charles R. Baxter initiated these procedures.[C2-210] As a\r\nresult of the infusion of liquids through the cutdowns, the cardiac\r\nmassage, and the airway, the doctors were able to maintain peripheral\r\ncirculation as monitored at the neck (carotid) artery and at the wrist\r\n(radial) pulse. A femoral pulse was also detected in the President\u2019s\r\nleg.[C2-211] While these medical efforts were in progress, Dr. Clark\r\nnoted some electrical activity on the cardiotachyscope attached to\r\nmonitor the President\u2019s heart responses.[C2-212] Dr. Clark, who most\r\nclosely observed the head wound, described a large, gaping wound in the\r\nright rear part of the head, with substantial damage and exposure of\r\nbrain tissue, and a considerable loss of blood.[C2-213] Dr. Clark did\r\nnot see any other hole or wound on the President\u2019s head.

Huber, Dr. Clark\r\npronounced the President dead. He made the official determination\r\nbecause the ultimate cause of death, the severe head injury, was within\r\nhis sphere of specialization.[C2-217] The time was fixed at 1 p.m.,\r\nas an approximation, since it was impossible to determine the precise\r\nmoment when life left the President.[C2-218] President Kennedy could\r\nhave survived the neck injury, but the head wound was fatal.[C2-219]\r\nFrom a medical viewpoint, President Kennedy was alive when he arrived\r\nat Parkland Hospital; the doctors observed that he had a heart beat\r\nand was making some respiratory efforts.[C2-220] But his condition was\r\nhopeless, and the extraordinary efforts of the doctors to save him\r\ncould not help but to have been unavailing.\r\n\r\nSince the Dallas doctors directed all their efforts to controlling the\r\nmassive bleeding caused by the head wound, and to reconstructing an\r\nairway to his lungs, the President remained on his back throughout his\r\nmedical treatment at Parkland.[C2-221] When asked why he did not turn\r\nthe President over, Dr. Carrico testified as follows:\r\n\r\n    A. This man was in obvious extreme distress and any more\r\n    thorough inspection would have involved several minutes--well,\r\n    several--considerable time which at this juncture was not\r\n    available. A thorough inspection would have involved washing\r\n    and cleansing the back, and this is not practical in treating\r\n    an acutely injured patient. You have to determine which things,\r\n    which are immediately life threatening and cope with them,\r\n    before attempting to evaluate the full extent of the injuries.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you ever have occasion to look at the President\u2019s back?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir. Before--well, in trying to treat an acutely injured\r\n    patient, you have to establish an airway, adequate ventilation\r\n    and you have to establish adequate circulation. Before this was\r\n    accomplished the President\u2019s cardiac activity had ceased and\r\n    closed cardiac massage was instituted, which made it impossible\r\n    to inspect his back.\r\n\r\n    Q. Was any effort made to inspect the President\u2019s back after he\r\n    had expired?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. And why was no effort made at that time to inspect his back?\r\n\r\n\r\n    A. I suppose nobody really had the heart to do it.[C2-222]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Parkland doctors took no further action after the\r\nPresident had expired because they concluded that it was beyond the\r\nscope of their permissible duties.[C2-223]\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of Governor Connally\r\n\r\nWhile one medical team tried to revive President Kennedy, a second\r\nperformed a series of operations on the bullet wounds sustained by\r\nGovernor Connally.[C2-224] Governor Connally was originally seen by Dr.\r\nCarrico and Dr. Richard Dulany.[C2-225] While Dr. Carrico went on to\r\nattend the President, Dr. Dulany stayed with the Governor and was soon\r\njoined by several other doctors.[C2-226] At approximately 12:45 p.m.,\r\nDr. Robert Shaw, chief of thoracic surgery, arrived at trauma room 2,\r\nto take charge of the care of Governor Connally, whose major wound fell\r\nwithin Dr. Shaw\u2019s area of specialization.[C2-227]\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally had a large sucking wound in the front of the right\r\nchest which caused extreme pain and difficulty in breathing.

Other Secret Service agents posted themselves in the\r\ncorridors and other areas near the emergency room. Special Agent Lawson\r\nmade certain that the Dallas police kept the public and press away\r\nfrom the immediate area of the hospital.[C2-250] Agents Kellerman and\r\nHill telephoned the head of the White House detail, Gerald A.

The telephone line to Washington was\r\nkept open throughout the remainder of the stay at the hospital.[C2-251]\r\n\r\nSecret Service agents stationed at later stops on the President\u2019s\r\nitinerary of November 22 were redeployed.

As soon as one of the agents learned of the shooting, he\r\nasked the officer in charge of the police detail at the airport to\r\ninstitute strict security measures for the Presidential aircraft, the\r\nairport terminal, and the surrounding area. The police were cautioned\r\nto prevent picture taking. Secret Service agents working with police\r\ncleared the areas adjacent to the aircraft, including warehouses,\r\nother terminal buildings and the neighboring parking lots, of all\r\npeople.[C2-254] The agents decided not to shift the Presidential\r\naircraft to the far side of the airport because the original landing\r\narea was secure and a move would require new measures.[C2-255]\r\n\r\nWhen security arrangements at the airport were complete, the Secret\r\nService made the necessary arrangements for the Vice President to leave\r\nthe hospital.

The second head wound measured approximately\r\n5 inches (13 centimeters) in its greatest diameter, but it was\r\ndifficult to measure accurately because multiple crisscross fractures\r\nradiated from the large defect.[C2-280] During the autopsy examination,\r\nFederal agents brought the surgeons three pieces of bone recovered from\r\nElm Street and the Presidential automobile. When put together, these\r\nfragments accounted for approximately three-quarters of the missing\r\nportion of the skull.[C2-281] The surgeons observed, through X-ray\r\nanalysis, 30 or 40 tiny dustlike fragments of metal running in a line\r\nfrom the wound in the rear of the President\u2019s head toward the front\r\npart of the skull, with a sizable metal fragment lying just above the\r\nright eye.[C2-282] From this head wound two small irregularly shaped\r\nfragments of metal were recovered and turned over to the FBI.[C2-283]\r\n\r\nThe autopsy also disclosed a wound near the base of the back of\r\nPresident Kennedy\u2019s neck slightly to the right of his spine.

In that connection the Commission has evaluated (1) the\r\ntestimony of eyewitnesses present at the scene of the assassination;\r\n(2) the damage to the Presidential limousine; (3) the examination by\r\nqualified experts of the rifle and cartridge cases found on the sixth\r\nfloor of the Texas School Book Depository and the bullet fragments\r\nfound in the Presidential limousine and at Parkland Hospital; (4)\r\nthe wounds suffered by President Kennedy and Governor Connally; (5)\r\nwound ballistics tests; (6) the examination by qualified experts of\r\nthe clothing worn by President Kennedy and Governor Connally; and (7)\r\nmotion-picture films and still photographs taken at the time of the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WITNESSES\r\n\r\nAs reflected in the previous chapter, passengers in the first few cars\r\nof the motorcade had the impression that the shots came from the rear\r\nand from the right, the general direction of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building, although none of these passengers saw anyone\r\nfire the shots. Some spectators at Houston and Elm Streets, however,\r\ndid see a rifle being fired in the direction of the President\u2019s car\r\nfrom the easternmost window of the sixth floor on the south side of\r\nthe building. Other witnesses saw a rifle in this window immediately\r\nafter the assassination. Three employees of the Depository, observing\r\nthe parade from the fifth floor, heard the shots fired from the floor\r\nimmediately above them. No credible evidence suggests that the shots\r\nwere fired from the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass, the\r\nnearby railroad yards or any place other than the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 477\r\n\r\nPosition of Howard L.

Howard L. Brennan, a 45-year-old steamfitter,\r\nwatched the motorcade from a concrete retaining wall at the southwest\r\ncorner of Elm and Houston, where he had a clear view of the south side\r\nof the Depository Building.[C3-1] (See Commission Exhibit No. 477, p.\r\n62.) He was approximately 107 feet from the Depository entrance and\r\n120 feet from the southeast corner window of the sixth floor.[C3-2]\r\nBrennan\u2019s presence and vantage point are corroborated by a motion\r\npicture of the motorcade taken by amateur photographer Abraham\r\nZapruder, which shows Brennan, wearing gray khaki work clothes and a\r\ngray work helmet, seated on the retaining wall.[C3-3] Brennan later\r\nidentified himself in the Zapruder movie.[C3-4] While waiting about\r\n7 minutes for the President to arrive, he observed the crowd on the\r\nstreet and the people at the windows of the Depository Building.[C3-5]\r\nHe noticed a man at the southeast corner window of the sixth floor, and\r\nobserved him leave the window \u201ca couple of times.\u201d[C3-6]\r\n\r\nBrennan watched the President\u2019s car as it turned the corner at Houston\r\nand Elm and moved down the incline toward the Triple Underpass.

As I calculate a couple\r\n    of seconds. He drew the gun back from the window as though he\r\n    was drawing it back to his side and maybe paused for another\r\n    second as though to assure hisself that he hit his mark, and\r\n    then he disappeared.[C3-8]\r\n\r\nBrennan stated that he saw 70 to 85 percent of the gun when it was\r\nfired and the body of the man from the waist up.[C3-9] The rifle was\r\naimed southwesterly down Elm Street toward the underpass.[C3-10]\r\nBrennan saw the man fire one shot and he remembered hearing a total\r\nof only two shots. When questioned about the number of shots, Brennan\r\ntestified:\r\n\r\n    I don\u2019t know what made me think that there was firecrackers\r\n    throwed out of the Book Store unless I did hear the second\r\n    shot, because I positively thought the first shot was a\r\n    backfire, and subconsciously I must have heard a second shot,\r\n    but I do not recall it. I could not swear to it.[C3-11]\r\n\r\nBrennan quickly reported his observations to police officers.[C3-12]\r\nBrennan\u2019s description of the man he saw is discussed in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nAmos Lee Euins, a 15-year-old ninth grade student, stated that he was\r\nfacing the Depository as the motorcade turned the corner at Elm and\r\nHouston. He recalled:\r\n\r\n    Then I was standing here, and as the motorcade turned the\r\n    corner, I was facing, looking dead at the building. And so I\r\n    seen this pipe thing sticking out the window. I wasn\u2019t paying\r\n    too much attention to it. Then when the first shot was fired, I\r\n    started looking around, thinking it was a backfire. Everybody\r\n    else started looking around. Then I looked up at the window,\r\n    and he shot again.[C3-13]\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing the first shots, Euins hid behind a fountain bench\r\nand saw the man shoot again from the window in the southeast corner of\r\nthe Depository\u2019s sixth floor.[C3-14] According to Euins, the man had\r\none hand on the barrel and the other on the trigger. Euins believed\r\nthat there were four shots.[C3-15] Immediately after the assassination,\r\nhe reported his observations to Sgt. D.\u00a0V. Harkness of the Dallas\r\nPolice Department and also to James Underwood of station KRLD-TV of\r\nDallas.[C3-16] Sergeant Harkness testified that Euins told him that\r\nthe shots came from the last window of the floor \u201cunder the ledge\u201d\r\non the side of the building they were facing.[C3-17] Based on Euins\u2019\r\nstatements, Harkness radioed to headquarters at 12:36 p.m. that \u201cI have\r\na witness that says that it came from the fifth floor of the Texas Book\r\nDepository Store.\u201d[C3-18] Euins accurately described the sixth floor as\r\nthe floor \u201cunder the ledge.\u201d Harkness testified that the error in the\r\nradio message was due to his own \u201chasty count of the floors.\u201d[C3-19]\r\n\r\nOther witnesses saw a rifle in the window after the shots were fired.\r\nRobert H.

Jackson, staff photographer, Dallas Times Herald, was in a\r\npress car in the Presidential motorcade, eight or nine cars from the\r\nfront. On Houston Street about halfway between Main and Elm, Jackson\r\nheard the first shot.[C3-20] As someone in the car commented that it\r\nsounded like a firecracker, Jackson heard two more shots.[C3-21] He\r\ntestified:\r\n\r\n    Then we realized or we thought that it was gunfire, and then we\r\n    could not at that point see the President\u2019s car. We were still\r\n    moving slowly, and after the third shot the second two shots\r\n    seemed much closer together than the first shot, than they were\r\n    to the first shot. Then after the last shot, I guess all of\r\n    us were just looking all around and I just looked straight up\r\n    ahead of me which would have been looking at the School Book\r\n    Depository and I noticed two Negro men in a window straining to\r\n    see directly above them, and my eyes followed right on up to\r\n    the window above them and I saw the rifle or what looked like\r\n    a rifle approximately half of the weapon, I guess I saw, and\r\n    just as I looked at it, it was drawn fairly slowly back into\r\n    the building, and I saw no one in the window with it.\r\n\r\n    I didn\u2019t even see a form in the window.[C3-22]\r\n\r\nIn the car with Jackson were James Underwood, television station\r\nKRLD-TV; Thomas Dillard, chief photographer, Dallas Morning News;\r\nMalcolm O.

Dillard, Couch, and Underwood confirmed that Jackson\r\nspontaneously exclaimed that he saw a rifle in the window.[C3-23]\r\nAccording to Dillard, at the time the shots were fired he and his\r\nfellow passengers \u201chad an absolutely perfect view of the School\r\nDepository from our position in the open car.\u201d[C3-24] Dillard\r\nimmediately took two pictures of the building: one of the east\r\ntwo-thirds of the south side and the other of the southeast corner,\r\nparticularly the fifth- and sixth-floor windows.[C3-25] These pictures\r\nshow three Negro men in windows on the fifth floor and the partially\r\nopen window on the sixth floor directly above them.

Couch also saw the rifle in the window,\r\nand testified:\r\n\r\n    And after the third shot, Bob Jackson, who was, as I recall,\r\n    on my right, yelled something like, \u201cLook up in the window!\r\n    There\u2019s the rifle!\u201d\r\n\r\n    And I remember glancing up to a window on the far right, which\r\n    at the time impressed me as the sixth or seventh floor, and\r\n    seeing about a foot of a rifle being--the barrel brought into\r\n    the window.[C3-26]\r\n\r\nCouch testified he saw people standing in other windows on the third\r\nor fourth floor in the middle of the south side, one of them being a\r\nNegro in a white T-shirt leaning out to look up at the windows above\r\nhim.[C3-27]\r\n\r\nMayor and Mrs. Earle Cabell rode in the motorcade immediately behind\r\nthe Vice-Presidential followup car.[C3-28] Mrs. Cabell was seated in\r\nthe back seat behind the driver and was facing U.S. Representative\r\nRay Roberts on her right as the car made the turn at Elm and Houston.\r\nIn this position Mrs. Cabell \u201cwas actually facing\u201d the seven-story\r\nDepository when the first shot rang out.", "start_char_idx": 211868, "end_char_idx": 215875, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a69315b-6802-49f7-b20f-57e3d748b207": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a69315b-6802-49f7-b20f-57e3d748b207", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aae6c7e1-6629-430b-9abf-ed786c0b4604", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "61da95b509f238b818279e24be3483eb4a87c50a87ec7901e43ffe62fc966f0c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "da5aec25-23e5-424e-898b-3da643030b6d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec47619e2fcc19536d89de41cf31275a29e385bb13b4091960754f303e357620", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C3-26]\r\n\r\nCouch testified he saw people standing in other windows on the third\r\nor fourth floor in the middle of the south side, one of them being a\r\nNegro in a white T-shirt leaning out to look up at the windows above\r\nhim.[C3-27]\r\n\r\nMayor and Mrs. Earle Cabell rode in the motorcade immediately behind\r\nthe Vice-Presidential followup car.[C3-28] Mrs. Cabell was seated in\r\nthe back seat behind the driver and was facing U.S. Representative\r\nRay Roberts on her right as the car made the turn at Elm and Houston.\r\nIn this position Mrs. Cabell \u201cwas actually facing\u201d the seven-story\r\nDepository when the first shot rang out.[C3-29] She \u201cjerked\u201d her head\r\nup immediately and saw a \u201cprojection\u201d in the first group of windows\r\non a floor which she described both as the sixth floor and the top\r\nfloor.[C3-30] According to Mrs. Cabell, the object was \u201crather long\r\nlooking,\u201d but she was unable to determine whether it was a mechanical\r\nobject or a person\u2019s arm.[C3-31] She turned away from the window to\r\ntell her husband that the noise was a shot, and \u201cjust as I got the\r\nwords out * * * the second two shots rang out.\u201d[C3-32] Mrs. Cabell did\r\nnot look at the sixth-floor window when the second and third shots were\r\nfired.[C3-33]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DILLARD EXHIBIT C\r\n\r\nEnlargement of photograph taken by Thomas C.

At that time members of the\r\nCommission\u2019s legal staff conducted an experiment. Norman, Williams,\r\nand Jarman placed themselves at the windows of the fifth floor as they\r\nhad been on November 22. A Secret Service agent operated the bolt of\r\na rifle directly above them at the southeast corner window of the\r\nsixth floor. At the same time, three cartridge shells were dropped to\r\nthe floor at intervals of about 3 seconds. According to Norman, the\r\nnoise outside was less on the day of the assassination than on the day\r\nof the test.[C3-55] He testified, \u201cWell, I heard the same sound, the\r\nsound similar. I heard three something that he dropped on the floor and\r\nthen I could hear the rifle or whatever he had up there.\u201d[C3-56] The\r\nexperiment with the shells and rifle was repeated for members of the\r\nCommission on May 9, 1964, on June 7, 1964, and again on September 6,\r\n1964. All seven of the Commissioners clearly heard the shells drop to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Triple Underpass\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the testimony of the witnesses who heard and observed\r\nshots fired from the Depository, the Commission\u2019s investigation has\r\ndisclosed no credible evidence that any shots were fired from anywhere\r\nelse. When the shots were fired, many people near the Depository\r\nbelieved that the shots came from the railroad bridge over the Triple\r\nUnderpass or from the area to the west of the Depository.[C3-57] In\r\nthe hectic moments after the assassination, many spectators ran in\r\nthe general direction of the Triple Underpass or the railroad yards\r\nnorthwest of the building. Some were running toward the place from\r\nwhich the sound of the rifle fire appeared to come, others were fleeing\r\nthe scene of the shooting.[C3-58] None of these people saw anyone with\r\na rifle, and the Commission\u2019s inquiry has yielded no evidence that\r\nshots were fired from the bridge over the Triple Underpass or from the\r\nrailroad yards.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the motorcade, Patrolman J.\u00a0W. Foster stood on the east\r\nside of the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass and Patrolman\r\nJ.\u00a0C. White stood on the west side.[C3-59] Patrolman Joe E. Murphy\r\nwas standing over Elm Street on the Stemmons Freeway overpass, west\r\nof the railroad bridge farther away from the Depository.[C3-60] Two\r\nother officers were stationed on Stemmons Freeway to control traffic\r\nas the motorcade entered the Freeway.[C3-61] Under the advance\r\npreparations worked out between the Secret Service and the Dallas\r\nPolice Department, the policemen were under instructions to keep\r\n\u201cunauthorized\u201d people away from these locations.[C3-62] When the\r\nmotorcade reached the intersection of Elm and Houston Streets, there\r\nwere no spectators on Stemmons Freeway where Patrolman Murphy was\r\nstationed.[C3-63] Patrolman Foster estimated that there were 10 or 11\r\npeople on the railroad bridge where he was assigned;[C3-64] another\r\nwitness testified that there were between 14 and 18 people there as the\r\nmotorcade came into view.[C3-65] Investigation has disclosed 15 persons\r\nwho were on the railroad bridge at this time, including 2 policemen,\r\n2 employees of the Texas-Louisiana Freight Bureau and 11 employees of\r\nthe Union Terminal Co.[C3-66] In the absence of any explicit definition\r\nof \u201cunauthorized\u201d persons, the policemen permitted these employees to\r\nremain on the railroad bridge to watch the motorcade.

From the tower he could view\r\npeople moving in the railroad yards and at the rear of the Depository.\r\nAccording to Bowers, \u201cSince approximately 10 o\u2019clock in the morning\r\ntraffic had been cut off into the area so that anyone moving around\r\ncould actually be observed.\u201d[C3-71] During the 20 minutes prior to\r\nthe arrival of the motorcade, Bowers noticed three automobiles which\r\nentered his immediate area; two left without discharging any passengers\r\nand the third was apparently on its way out when last observed by\r\nBowers.[C3-72] Bowers observed only three or four people in the general\r\narea, as well as a few bystanders on the railroad bridge over the\r\nTriple Underpass.[C3-73]\r\n\r\nAs the motorcade proceeded toward the Triple Underpass, the spectators\r\nwere clustered together along the east concrete wall of the railroad\r\nbridge facing the oncoming procession.[C3-74] (See Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 2215, p. 75.) Patrolman Foster stood immediately behind them and\r\ncould observe all of them.[C3-75] Secret Service agents in the lead car\r\nof the motorcade observed the bystanders and the police officer on the\r\nbridge.[C3-76] Special Agent Winston G. Lawson motioned through the\r\nwindshield in an unsuccessful attempt to instruct Patrolman Foster to\r\nmove the people away from their position directly over the path of the\r\nmotorcade.[C3-77] Some distance away, on the Stemmons Freeway overpass\r\nabove Elm Street, Patrolman Murphy also had the group on the railroad\r\nbridge within view.[C3-78] When he heard the shots, Foster rushed to\r\nthe wall of the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass and looked\r\ntoward the street.[C3-79] After the third shot, Foster ran toward the\r\nDepository and shortly thereafter informed Inspector Herbert J.

Holland, there were four shots which sounded as\r\nthough they came from the trees on the north side of Elm Street where\r\nhe saw a puff of smoke.[C3-84] Thomas J. Murphy, a mail foreman at\r\nUnion Terminal Co., heard two shots and said that they came from a\r\nspot just west of the Depository.[C3-85] In the railroad tower, Bowers\r\nheard three shots, which sounded as though they came either from the\r\nDepository Building or near the mouth of the Triple Underpass. Prior\r\nto November 22, 1963, Bowers had noted the similarity of the sounds\r\ncoming from the vicinity of the Depository and those from the Triple\r\nUnderpass, which he attributed to \u201ca reverberation which takes place\r\nfrom either location.\u201d[C3-86]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the shots were fired, neither the policemen nor\r\nthe spectators on the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass saw\r\nanything suspicious on the bridge in their vicinity. (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 2214, p. 74.) No one saw anyone with a rifle. As he ran\r\naround through the railroad yards to the Depository, Patrolman Foster\r\nsaw no suspicious activity.[C3-87] The same was true of the other\r\nbystanders, many of whom made an effort after the shooting to observe\r\nany unusual activity. Holland, for example, immediately after the\r\nshots, ran off the overpass to see if there was anyone behind the\r\npicket fence on the north side of Elm Street, but he did not see anyone\r\namong the parked cars.[C3-88] Miller did not see anyone running across\r\nthe railroad tracks or on the plaza west of the Depository.[C3-89]\r\nBowers and others saw a motorcycle officer dismount hurriedly and\r\ncome running up the incline on the north side of Elm Street.[C3-90]\r\nThe motorcycle officer, Clyde A. Haygood, saw no one running from the\r\nrailroad yards.[C3-91]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL AUTOMOBILE\r\n\r\nAfter the Presidential car was returned to Washington on November 22,\r\n1963, Secret Service agents found two bullet fragments in the front\r\nseat.

It was also compared with bullet fragments found\r\nat Parkland Hospital. All these bullet fragments were found to be\r\nsimilar in metallic composition, but it was not possible to determine\r\nwhether two or more of the fragments came from the same bullet.[C3-98]\r\nIt is possible for the fragments from the front seat to have been a\r\npart of the same bullet as the three fragments found near the left\r\njump seat,[C3-99] since a whole bullet of this type weighs 160-161\r\ngrains.[C3-100] (See app. X, pp. 555-558.)\r\n\r\nThe physical characteristics of the windshield after the assassination\r\ndemonstrate that the windshield was struck on the inside surface. The\r\nwindshield is composed of two layers of glass with a very thin layer\r\nof plastic in the middle \u201cwhich bonds them together in the form of\r\nsafety glass.\u201d[C3-101] The windshield was extracted from the automobile\r\nand was examined during a Commission hearing.[C3-102] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 350, p. 78.) According to Robert A. Frazier, FBI firearms\r\nexpert, the fact that cracks were present on the outer layer of glass\r\nshowed that the glass had been struck from the inside. He testified\r\nthat the windshield\r\n\r\n    could not have been struck on the outside surface because of\r\n    the manner in which the glass broke and further because of the\r\n    lead residue on the inside surface. The cracks appear in the\r\n    outer layer of the glass because the glass is bent outward at\r\n    the time of impact which stretches the outer layer of the glass\r\n    to the point where these small radial or wagon spoke, wagon\r\n    wheel spoke-type cracks appear on the outer surface.[C3-103]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is some uncertainty whether the dent in the chrome on\r\nthe windshield was present prior to the assassination,[C3-104] Frazier\r\ntestified that the dent \u201chad been caused by some projectile which\r\nstruck the chrome on the inside surface.\u201d[C3-105] If it was caused\r\nby a shot during the assassination, Frazier stated that it would not\r\nhave been caused by a bullet traveling at full velocity, but rather\r\nby a fragment traveling at \u201cfairly high velocity.\u201d[C3-106] It could\r\nhave been caused by either fragment found in the front seat of the\r\nlimousine.[C3-107]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 350\r\n\r\nWindshield of Presidential limousine.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERT EXAMINATION OF RIFLE, CARTRIDGE CASES, AND BULLET FRAGMENTS\r\n\r\nOn the sixth floor of the Depository Building, the Dallas police\r\nfound three spent cartridges and a rifle.

Day of the Dallas Police Department arrived and took photographs\r\nof the cartridge cases before anything had been moved.[C3-113]\r\n\r\nAt 1:22 p.m. Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone and Deputy Constable Seymour\r\nWeitzman found a bolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight between two\r\nrows of boxes in the northwest corner near the staircase on the sixth\r\nfloor.[C3-114] No one touched the weapon or otherwise disturbed the\r\nscene until Captain Fritz and Lieutenant Day arrived and the weapon\r\nwas photographed as it lay on the floor.[C3-115] After Lieutenant Day\r\ndetermined that there were no fingerprints on the knob of the bolt and\r\nthat the wooden stock was too rough to take fingerprints, he picked the\r\nrifle up by the stock and held it that way while Captain Fritz opened\r\nthe bolt and ejected a live round.[C3-116] Lieutenant Day retained\r\npossession of the weapon and took it back to the police department\r\nfor examination.[C3-117] Neither Boone nor Weitzman handled the\r\nrifle.[C3-118]\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscovery of Bullet at Parkland Hospital\r\n\r\nA nearly whole bullet was found on Governor Connally\u2019s stretcher\r\nat Parkland Hospital after the assassination. After his arrival at\r\nthe hospital the Governor was brought into trauma room No. 2 on a\r\nstretcher, removed from the room on that stretcher a short time later,\r\nand taken on an elevator to the second-floor operating room.[C3-119] On\r\nthe second floor he was transferred from the stretcher to an operating\r\ntable which was then moved into the operating room, and a hospital\r\nattendant wheeled the empty stretcher into an elevator.[C3-120] Shortly\r\nafterward, Darrell C. Tomlinson, the hospital\u2019s senior engineer,\r\nremoved this stretcher from the elevator and placed it in the corridor\r\non the ground floor, alongside another stretcher wholly unconnected\r\nwith the care of Governor Connally.[C3-121] A few minutes later, he\r\nbumped one of the stretchers against the wall and a bullet rolled\r\nout.[C3-122]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 723\r\n\r\nShield of cartons around sixth floor southeast corner window.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Tomlinson was not certain whether the bullet came from the\r\nConnally stretcher or the adjacent one, the Commission has concluded\r\nthat the bullet came from the Governor\u2019s stretcher.

These markings have been explained as follows:\r\n\u201cMADE ITALY\u201d refers to its origin; \u201cCAL. 6.5\u201d refers to the rifle\u2019s\r\ncaliber; \u201c1940\u201d refers to the year of manufacture; and the number\r\nC2766 is the serial number. This rifle is the only one of its type\r\nbearing that serial number.[C3-127] After review of standard reference\r\nworks and the markings on the rifle, it was identified by the FBI as a\r\n6.5-millimeter model 91/38 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.[C3-128] Experts\r\nfrom the FBI made an independent determination of the caliber by\r\ninserting a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter cartridge into the weapon\r\nfor fit, and by making a sulfur cast of the inside of the weapon\u2019s\r\nbarrel and measuring the cast with a micrometer.[C3-129] From outward\r\nappearance, the weapon would appear to be a 7.35-millimeter rifle, but\r\nits mechanism had been rebarreled with a 6.5-millimeter barrel.[C3-130]\r\nConstable Deputy Sheriff Weitzman, who only saw the rifle at a glance\r\nand did not handle it, thought the weapon looked like a 7.65 Mauser\r\nbolt-action rifle.[C3-131] (See chapter V, p. 235.)\r\n\r\nThe rifle is 40.2 inches long and weighs 8 pounds.[C3-132] The\r\nminimum length broken down is 34.8 inches, the length of the wooden\r\nstock.[C3-133] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, p. 132.) Attached\r\nto the weapon is an inexpensive four-power telescopic sight,\r\nstamped \u201cOptics Ordnance Inc./Hollywood California,\u201d and \u201cMade in\r\nJapan.\u201d[C3-134] The weapon also bears a sling consisting of two leather\r\nstraps. The sling is not a standard rifle sling but appears to be a\r\nmusical instrument strap or a sling from a carrying case or camera\r\nbag.[C3-135]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1303]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBITS NOS. 541(2) AND 541(3)\r\n\r\nPhotograph of markings on C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nExpert Testimony\r\n\r\nFour experts in the field of firearms identification analyzed the\r\nnearly whole bullet, the two largest fragments and the three cartridge\r\ncases to determine whether they had been fired from the C2766\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository.\r\nTwo of these experts testified before the Commission.

Nicol, superintendent of the bureau of criminal\r\nidentification and investigation for the State of Illinois. Nicol\r\nalso has had long and substantial experience since 1941 in firearms\r\nidentification, and estimated that he has made thousands of bullet and\r\ncartridge case examinations.[C3-138]\r\n\r\nIn examining the bullet fragments and cartridge cases, these experts\r\napplied the general principles accepted in the field of firearms\r\nidentification, which are discussed in more detail in appendix X at\r\npages 547-553. In brief, a determination that a particular bullet or\r\ncartridge case has been fired in a particular weapon is based upon a\r\ncomparison of the bullet or case under examination with one or more\r\nbullets or cases known to have been fired in that weapon. When a bullet\r\nis fired in any given weapon, it is engraved with the characteristics\r\nof the weapon. In addition to the rifling characteristics of the\r\nbarrel which are common to all weapons of a given make and model,\r\nevery weapon bears distinctive microscopic markings on its barrel,\r\nfiring pin and bolt face.[C3-139] These markings arise initially\r\nduring manufacture, since the action of the manufacturing tools\r\ndiffers microscopically from weapon to weapon and since, in addition,\r\nthe tools change microscopically while being used. As a weapon is\r\nused further distinctive markings are introduced. Under microscopic\r\nexamination a qualified expert may be able to determine whether the\r\nmarkings on a bullet known to have been fired in a particular weapon\r\nand the markings on a suspect bullet are the same and, therefore,\r\nwhether both bullets were fired in the same weapon to the exclusion\r\nof all other weapons. Similarly, firearms identification experts are\r\nable to compare the markings left upon the base of cartridge cases and\r\nthereby determine whether both cartridges were fired by the same weapon\r\nto the exclusion of all other weapons. According to Frazier, such\r\nan identification \u201cis made on the presence of sufficient individual\r\nmicroscopic characteristics so that a very definite pattern is formed\r\nand visualized on the two surfaces.\u201d[C3-140] Under some circumstances,\r\nas where the bullet or cartridge case is seriously mutilated, there are\r\nnot sufficient individual characteristics to enable the expert to make\r\na firm identification.[C3-141]\r\n\r\nAfter making independent examinations, both Frazier and Nicol\r\npositively identified the nearly whole bullet from the stretcher and\r\nthe two larger bullet fragments found in the Presidential limousine as\r\nhaving been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the\r\nDepository to the exclusion of all other weapons.[C3-142] Each of the\r\ntwo bullet fragments had sufficient unmutilated area to provide the\r\nbasis for an identification.[C3-143] However, it was not possible to\r\ndetermine whether the two bullet fragments were from the same bullet\r\nor from two different bullets.[C3-144] With regard to the other bullet\r\nfragments discovered in the limousine and in the course of treating\r\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally, however, expert examination\r\ncould demonstrate only that the fragments were \u201csimilar in metallic\r\ncomposition\u201d to each other, to the two larger fragments and to the\r\nnearly whole bullet.[C3-145] After examination of the three cartridge\r\ncases found on the sixth floor of the Depository, Frazier and Nicol\r\nconcluded that they had been fired in the C2766

conclusions.[C3-147]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BULLET WOUNDS\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of the source of the shots fired at\r\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally, the Commission has also\r\nevaluated the expert medical testimony of the doctors who observed\r\nthe wounds during the emergency treatment at Parkland Hospital and\r\nduring the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital. It paid particular\r\nattention to any wound characteristics which would be of assistance\r\nin identifying a wound as the entrance or exit point of a missile.\r\nAdditional information regarding the source and nature of the injuries\r\nwas obtained by expert examination of the clothes worn by the two men,\r\nparticularly those worn by President Kennedy, and from the results of\r\nspecial wound ballistics tests conducted at the Commission\u2019s request,\r\nusing the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle with ammunition of the same\r\ntype as that used and found on November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President\u2019s Head Wounds\r\n\r\nThe detailed autopsy of President Kennedy performed on the night of\r\nNovember 22 at the Bethesda Naval Hospital led the three examining\r\npathologists to conclude that the smaller hole in the rear of the\r\nPresident\u2019s skull was the point of entry and that the large opening on\r\nthe right side of his head was the wound of exit.[C3-148] The smaller\r\nhole on the back of the President\u2019s head measured one-fourth of an\r\ninch by five-eighths of an inch (6 by 15 millimeters).[C3-149] The\r\ndimensions of that wound were consistent with having been caused by\r\na 6.5-millimeter bullet fired from behind and above which struck at\r\na tangent or an angle causing a 15-millimeter cut. The cut reflected\r\na larger dimension of entry than the bullet\u2019s diameter of 6.5\r\nmillimeters, since the missile, in effect, sliced along the skull for\r\na fractional distance until it entered.[C3-150] The dimension of 6\r\nmillimeters, somewhat smaller than the diameter of a 6.5-millimeter\r\nbullet, was caused by the elastic recoil of the skull which shrinks the\r\nsize of an opening after a missile passes through it.[C3-151]\r\n\r\nLt. Col. Pierre A. Finck, Chief of the Wound Ballistics Pathology\r\nBranch of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, who has\r\nhad extensive experience with bullet wounds, illustrated the\r\ncharacteristics which led to his conclusions about the head wound by\r\na chart prepared by him. This chart, based on Colonel Finck\u2019s studies\r\nof more than 400 cases, depicted the effect of a perforating missile\r\nwound on the human skull.[C3-152] When a bullet enters the skull\r\n(cranial vault) at one point and exits at another, it causes a beveling\r\nor cratering effect where the diameter of the hole is smaller on the\r\nimpact side than on the exit side. Based on his observations of that\r\nbeveling effect on the President\u2019s skull, Colonel Finck testified:\r\n\u201cPresident Kennedy was, in my opinion, shot from the rear.

J. Thornton\r\nBoswell, chief of pathology at Bethesda Naval Hospital, who assisted\r\nin the autopsy, to conclude that the bullet penetrated the rear of the\r\nPresident\u2019s head and exited through a large wound on the right side of\r\nhis head.[C3-157]\r\n\r\nBallistics experiments (discussed more fully in app. X, pp. 585-586)\r\nshowed that the rifle and bullets identified above were capable of\r\nproducing the President\u2019s head wound. The Wound Ballistics Branch of\r\nthe U.S. Army laboratories at Edgewood Arsenal, Md., conducted an\r\nextensive series of experiments to test the effect of Western Cartridge\r\nCo. 6.5-millimeter bullets, the type found on Governor Connally\u2019s\r\nstretcher and in the Presidential limousine, fired from the C2766\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the Depository. The Edgewood Arsenal\r\ntests were performed under the immediate supervision of Alfred G.\r\nOlivier, a doctor who had spent 7 years in wounds ballistics research\r\nfor the U.S. Army.[C3-158]\r\n\r\nOne series of tests, performed on reconstructed inert human skulls,\r\ndemonstrated that the President\u2019s head wound could have been caused\r\nby the rifle and bullets fired by the assassin from the sixth-floor\r\nwindow. The results of this series were illustrated by the findings on\r\none skull which was struck at a point closely approximating the wound\r\nof entry on President Kennedy\u2019s head. That bullet blew out the right\r\nside of the reconstructed skull in a manner very similar to the head\r\nwound of the President.[C3-159] As a result of these tests, Dr. Olivier\r\nconcluded that a Western Cartridge Co. 6.5 bullet fired from the C2766\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle at a distance of 90 yards would make the same\r\ntype of wound as that found on the President\u2019s head. Referring to the\r\nseries of tests, Dr. Olivier testified:\r\n\r\n    It disclosed that the type of head wounds that the President\r\n    received could be done by this type of bullet. This surprised\r\n    me very much, because this type of stable bullet I didn\u2019t\r\n    think would cause a massive head wound, I thought it would go\r\n    through making a small entrance and exit, but the bones of the\r\n    skull are enough to deform the end of this bullet causing it to\r\n    expend a lot of energy and blowing out the side of the skull or\r\n    blowing out fragments of the skull.[C3-160]\r\n\r\nAfter examining the fragments of the bullet which struck the\r\nreconstructed skull, Dr. Olivier stated that--\r\n\r\n    the recovered fragments were very similar to the ones recovered\r\n    on the front seat and on the floor of the car.\r\n\r\n    This, to me, indicates that those fragments did come from the\r\n    bullet that wounded the President in the head.[C3-161]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President\u2019s Neck Wounds\r\n\r\nDuring the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital another bullet wound\r\nwas observed near the base of the back of President Kennedy\u2019s neck\r\nslightly to the right of his spine which provides further enlightenment\r\nas to the source of the shots.", "start_char_idx": 249605, "end_char_idx": 253823, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e00d9e58-167a-4f35-abd4-fc2f586029c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e00d9e58-167a-4f35-abd4-fc2f586029c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "40f789dd-3775-43da-9bcb-2b69d56da1e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "1f6801fef68f665180b7cec0121ad9f5e0f78b57608f2eb5f1e5086da87a3c42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e59c25f-3f83-4658-9e9d-39da8e46fd0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e67767809262189752b9cb7364fb34e3a3180c9d1ad8baa6301882e5ef3f0bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C3-160]\r\n\r\nAfter examining the fragments of the bullet which struck the\r\nreconstructed skull, Dr. Olivier stated that--\r\n\r\n    the recovered fragments were very similar to the ones recovered\r\n    on the front seat and on the floor of the car.\r\n\r\n    This, to me, indicates that those fragments did come from the\r\n    bullet that wounded the President in the head.[C3-161]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President\u2019s Neck Wounds\r\n\r\nDuring the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital another bullet wound\r\nwas observed near the base of the back of President Kennedy\u2019s neck\r\nslightly to the right of his spine which provides further enlightenment\r\nas to the source of the shots. The hole was located approximately 5\u00bd\r\ninches (14 centimeters) from the tip of the right shoulder joint and\r\napproximately the same distance below the tip of the right mastoid\r\nprocess, the bony point immediately behind the ear.[C3-162] The\r\nwound was approximately one-fourth by one-seventh of an inch (7 by\r\n4 millimeters), had clean edges, was sharply delineated, and had\r\nmargins similar in all respects to those of the entry wound in the\r\nskull.[C3-163] Commanders Humes and Boswell agreed with Colonel Finck\u2019s\r\ntestimony that this hole--\r\n\r\n    * * * is a wound of entrance. * * * The basis for that\r\n    conclusion is that this wound was relatively small with clean\r\n    edges. It was not a jagged wound, and that is what we see in\r\n    wound of entrance at a long range.[C3-164]\r\n\r\nThe autopsy examination further disclosed that, after entering the\r\nPresident, the bullet passed between two large muscles, produced a\r\ncontusion on the upper part of the pleural cavity (without penetrating\r\nthat cavity), bruised the top portion of the right lung and ripped the\r\nwindpipe (trachea) in its path through the President\u2019s neck.[C3-165]\r\nThe examining surgeons concluded that the wounds were caused by the\r\nbullet rather than the tracheotomy performed at Parkland Hospital.\r\nThe nature of the bruises indicated that the President\u2019s heart and\r\nlungs were functioning when the bruises were caused, whereas there\r\nwas very little circulation in the President\u2019s body when incisions\r\non the President\u2019s chest were made to insert tubes during the\r\ntracheotomy.[C3-166] No bone was struck by the bullet which passed\r\nthrough the President\u2019s body.[C3-167] By projecting from a point of\r\nentry on the rear of the neck and proceeding at a slight downward angle\r\nthrough the bruised interior portions, the doctors concluded that the\r\nbullet exited from the front portion of the President\u2019s neck that had\r\nbeen cut away by the tracheotomy.[C3-168]\r\n\r\nConcluding that a bullet passed through the President\u2019s neck, the\r\ndoctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital rejected a theory that the bullet\r\nlodged in the large muscles in the back of his neck and fell out\r\nthrough the point of entry when external heart massage was applied at\r\nParkland Hospital. In the earlier stages of the autopsy, the surgeons\r\nwere unable to find a path into any large muscle in the back of the\r\nneck. At that time they did not know that there had been a bullet\r\nhole in the front of the President\u2019s neck when he arrived at Parkland\r\nHospital because the tracheotomy incision had completely eliminated\r\nthat evidence.[C3-169] While the autopsy was being performed, surgeons\r\nlearned that a whole bullet had been found at Parkland Hospital on\r\na stretcher which, at that time, was thought to be the stretcher\r\noccupied by the President. This led to speculation that the bullet\r\nmight have penetrated a short distance into the back of the neck and\r\nthen dropped out onto the stretcher as a result of the external heart\r\nmassage.[C3-170]\r\n\r\nFurther exploration during the autopsy disproved that theory. The\r\nsurgeons determined that the bullet had passed between two large strap\r\nmuscles and bruised them without leaving any channel, since the bullet\r\nmerely passed between them.[C3-171] Commander Humes, who believed\r\nthat a tracheotomy had been performed from his observations at the\r\nautopsy, talked by telephone with Dr. Perry early on the morning of\r\nNovember 23, and learned that his assumption was correct and that Dr.\r\nPerry had used the missile wound in the neck as the point to make the\r\nincision.[C3-172] This confirmed the Bethesda surgeons\u2019 conclusion that\r\nthe bullet had exited from the front part of the neck.\r\n\r\nThe findings of the doctors who conducted the autopsy were consistent\r\nwith the observations of the doctors who treated the President at\r\nParkland Hospital.

Dr. Charles S. Carrico, a resident surgeon at\r\nParkland, noted a small wound approximately one-fourth of an inch in\r\ndiameter (5 to 8 millimeters) in the lower third of the neck below\r\nthe Adam\u2019s apple.[C3-173] Dr. Malcolm O. Perry, who performed the\r\ntracheotomy, described the wound as approximately one-fifth of an inch\r\nin diameter (5 millimeters) and exuding blood which partially hid edges\r\nthat were \u201cneither cleancut, that is, punched out, nor were they very\r\nragged.\u201d[C3-174] Dr. Carrico testified as follows:\r\n\r\n    Q. Based on your observations on the neck wound alone did you\r\n    have a sufficient basis to form an opinion as to whether it was\r\n    an entrance or an exit wound?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir; we did not. Not having completely evaluated all\r\n    the wounds, traced out the course of the bullets, this wound\r\n    would have been compatible with either entrance or exit wound\r\n    depending upon the size, the velocity, the tissue structure and\r\n    so forth.[C3-175]\r\n\r\nThe same response was made by Dr. Perry to a similar query:\r\n\r\n    Q. Based on the appearance of the neck wound alone, could it\r\n    have been either an entrance or an exit wound?\r\n\r\n    A. It could have been either.[C3-176]\r\n\r\nThen each doctor was asked to take into account the other known facts,\r\nsuch as the autopsy findings, the approximate distance the bullet\r\ntraveled and tested muzzle velocity of the assassination weapon. With\r\nthese additional factors, the doctors commented on the wound on the\r\nfront of the President\u2019s neck as follows:\r\n\r\n    Dr. CARRICO. With those facts and the fact as I understand it\r\n    no other bullet was found this would be, this was, I believe,\r\n    was an exit wound.[C3-177]\r\n\r\n    Dr. PERRY. A full jacketed bullet without deformation passing\r\n    through skin would leave a similar wound for an exit and\r\n    entrance wound and with the facts which you have made available\r\n    and with these assumptions, I believe that it was an exit\r\n    wound.[C3-178]\r\n\r\nOther doctors at Parkland Hospital who observed the wound prior to\r\nthe tracheotomy agreed with the observations of Drs. Perry and\r\nCarrico.[C3-179] The bullet wound in the neck could be seen for only\r\na short time, since Dr. Perry eliminated evidence of it when he\r\nperformed the tracheotomy. He selected that spot since it was the point\r\nwhere such an operation was customarily performed, and it was one\r\nof the safest and easiest spots from which to reach the trachea. In\r\naddition, there was possibly an underlying wound to the muscles in the\r\nneck, the carotid artery or the jugular vein, and Dr. Perry concluded\r\nthat the incision, therefore, had to be low in order to maintain\r\nrespiration.[C3-180]\r\n\r\nConsiderable confusion has arisen because of comments attributed to\r\nDr. Perry concerning the nature of the neck wound. Immediately after\r\nthe assassination, many people reached erroneous conclusions about the\r\nsource of the shots because of Dr. Perry\u2019s observations to the press.\r\nOn the afternoon of November 22, a press conference was organized\r\nat Parkland Hospital by members of the White House press staff and\r\na hospital administrator.

At that time, Dr. Perry did not know\r\nabout either the wound on the back of the President\u2019s neck or the small\r\nbullet-hole wound in the back of the head. As described in chapter\r\nII, the President was lying on his back during his entire time at\r\nParkland. The small hole in the head was also hidden from view by the\r\nlarge quantity of blood which covered the President\u2019s head. Dr. Perry\r\nsaid his answers at the press conference were intended to convey his\r\ntheory about what could have happened, based on his limited knowledge\r\nat the time, rather than his professional opinion about what did\r\nhappen.[C3-184] Commenting on his answers at the press conference, Dr.\r\nPerry testified before the Commission:\r\n\r\n    I expressed it [his answers] as a matter of speculation that\r\n    this was conceivable. But, again, Dr. Clark [who also answered\r\n    questions at the conference] and I emphasized that we had no\r\n    way of knowing.[C3-185]\r\n\r\nDr. Perry\u2019s recollection of his comments is corroborated by some of the\r\nnews stories after the press conference. The New York Herald Tribune on\r\nNovember 23, 1963, reported as follows:\r\n\r\n     Dr. Malcolm Perry, 34, attendant surgeon at Parkland Hospital\r\n    who attended the President, said he saw two wounds--one below\r\n    the Adam\u2019s apple, the other at the back of the head. He said he\r\n    did not know if two bullets were involved. It is possible, he\r\n    said, that the neck wound was the entrance and the other the\r\n    exit of the missile.[C3-186]\r\n\r\nAccording to this report, Dr. Perry stated merely that it was\r\n\u201cpossible\u201d that the neck wound was a wound of entrance. This conforms\r\nwith his testimony before the Commission, where he stated that by\r\nthemselves the characteristics of the neck wound were consistent with\r\nbeing either a point of entry or exit.\r\n\r\n_Wound ballistics tests._--Experiments performed by the Army Wound\r\nBallistics experts at Edgewood Arsenal, Md. (discussed in app. X, p.\r\n582) showed that under simulated conditions entry and exit wounds are\r\nvery similar in appearance. After reviewing the path of the bullet\r\nthrough the President\u2019s neck, as disclosed in the autopsy report,\r\nthe experts simulated the neck by using comparable material with a\r\nthickness of approximately 5\u00bd inches (13\u00bd to 14\u00bd centimeters), which\r\nwas the distance traversed by the bullet. Animal skin was placed on\r\neach side, and Western Cartridge Co. 6.5 bullets were fired from the\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle from a distance of 180 feet. The animal\r\nskin on the entry side showed holes which were regular and round.\r\nOn the exit side two holes were only slightly elongated, indicating\r\nthat the bullet had become only a little unstable at the point of\r\nexit.[C3-187] A third exit hole was round, although not quite as\r\nregular as the entry holes.", "start_char_idx": 260258, "end_char_idx": 264531, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56accb73-6995-45c5-9995-3be38bc58746": {"__data__": {"id_": "56accb73-6995-45c5-9995-3be38bc58746", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffe9c5bf-4c9e-468e-88dc-5275d90040bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "829c27e0e711fe5f56f2f6ceebba3c2602b6e7ef5b6d7ad9a2b90d8be444fee4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a11139d-29ca-46c4-b9e2-0b9af3a9b938", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ceb90b8dba98db912b74ae9ea4d2e77e2f9c0e141e93c1f9a36b5fa817307a7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "X, p.\r\n582) showed that under simulated conditions entry and exit wounds are\r\nvery similar in appearance.

Perry and Carrico of the hole in the front of the President\u2019s\r\nneck.[C3-189]\r\n\r\nThe autopsy disclosed that the bullet which entered the back of the\r\nPresident\u2019s neck hit no bony structure and proceeded in a slightly\r\ndownward angle. The markings on the President\u2019s clothing indicate\r\nthat the bullet moved in a slight right to left lateral direction as\r\nit passed through the President\u2019s body.[C3-190] After the examining\r\ndoctors expressed the thought that a bullet would have lost very\r\nlittle velocity in passing through the soft tissue of the neck, wound\r\nballistics experts conducted tests to measure the exit velocity of\r\nthe bullet.[C3-191] The tests were the same as those used to create\r\nentry and exit holes, supplemented by the use of break-type screens\r\nwhich measured the velocity of bullets. The entrance velocity of the\r\nbullet fired from the rifle averaged 1,904 feet per second after it\r\ntraveled 180 feet. The exit velocity averaged 1,772 to 1,798 feet per\r\nsecond, depending upon the substance through which the bullet passed.\r\nA photograph of the path of the bullet traveling through the simulated\r\nneck showed that it proceeded in a straight line and was stable.[C3-192]\r\n\r\n_Examination of clothing._--The clothing worn by President Kennedy on\r\nNovember 22 had holes and tears which showed that a missile entered\r\nthe back of his clothing in the vicinity of his lower neck and exited\r\nthrough the front of his shirt immediately behind his tie, nicking the\r\nknot of his tie in its forward flight.[C3-193] Although the caliber\r\nof the bullet could not be determined and some of the clothing items\r\nprecluded a positive determination that some tears were made by a\r\nbullet, all the defects could have been caused by a 6.5-millimeter\r\nbullet entering the back of the President\u2019s lower neck and exiting in\r\nthe area of the knot of his tie.[C3-194]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the suit jacket worn by the President by FBI Agent\r\nFrazier revealed a roughly circular hole approximately one-fourth of\r\nan inch in diameter on the rear of the coat, 5\u215c inches below the top\r\nof the collar and 1\u00be inches to the right of the center back seam of\r\nthe coat.[C3-195] The hole was visible on the upper rear of the coat\r\nslightly to the right of center. Traces of copper were found in the\r\nmargins of the hole and the cloth fibers around the margins were pushed\r\ninward.[C3-196] Those characteristics established that the hole was\r\ncaused by an entering bullet.[C3-197] Although the precise size of the\r\nbullet could not be determined from the hole, it was consistent with\r\nhaving been made by a 6.5-millimeter bullet.[C3-198]\r\n\r\nThe shirt worn by the President contained a hole on the back side 5\u00be\r\ninches below the top of the collar and 1\u215b inches to the right of the\r\nmiddle of the back of the shirt.[C3-199] The hole on the rear of the\r\nshirt was approximately circular in shape and about one-fourth of an\r\ninch in diameter, with the fibers pressed inward.[C3-200] These factors\r\nestablished it as a bullet entrance hole.[C3-201] The relative position\r\nof the hole in the back of the suit jacket to the hole in the back\r\nof the shirt indicated that both were caused by the same penetrating\r\nmissile.[C3-202]\r\n\r\nOn the front of the shirt, examination revealed a hole seven-eighths\r\nof an inch below the collar button and a similar opening seven-eighths\r\nof an inch below the buttonhole.", "start_char_idx": 263673, "end_char_idx": 268030, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a11139d-29ca-46c4-b9e2-0b9af3a9b938": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a11139d-29ca-46c4-b9e2-0b9af3a9b938", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "56accb73-6995-45c5-9995-3be38bc58746", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ff91171e77856dd359c5ab1f91a5f5a6aeac09247d0c02ee592cf76b1c739118", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "17881d79-4724-4723-924b-9293733e6de3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2eb7478d4f3500c15ece4824f59a3d2fa2fdf974ea18a476a12feffd8a15fa3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C3-198]\r\n\r\nThe shirt worn by the President contained a hole on the back side 5\u00be\r\ninches below the top of the collar and 1\u215b inches to the right of the\r\nmiddle of the back of the shirt.[C3-199] The hole on the rear of the\r\nshirt was approximately circular in shape and about one-fourth of an\r\ninch in diameter, with the fibers pressed inward.[C3-200] These factors\r\nestablished it as a bullet entrance hole.[C3-201] The relative position\r\nof the hole in the back of the suit jacket to the hole in the back\r\nof the shirt indicated that both were caused by the same penetrating\r\nmissile.[C3-202]\r\n\r\nOn the front of the shirt, examination revealed a hole seven-eighths\r\nof an inch below the collar button and a similar opening seven-eighths\r\nof an inch below the buttonhole. These two holes fell into alinement\r\non overlapping positions when the shirt was buttoned.[C3-203] Each\r\nhole was a vertical, ragged slit approximately one-half of an inch\r\nin height, with the cloth fibers protruding outward. Although the\r\ncharacteristics of the slit established that the missile had exited\r\nto the front, the irregular nature of the slit precluded a positive\r\ndetermination that it was a bullet hole.[C3-204] However, the hole\r\ncould have been caused by a round bullet although the characteristics\r\nwere not sufficiently clear to enable the examining expert to render a\r\nconclusive opinion.[C3-205]\r\n\r\nWhen the President\u2019s clothing was removed at Parkland Hospital, his tie\r\nwas cut off by severing the loop immediately to the wearer\u2019s left of\r\nthe knot, leaving the knot in its original condition.[C3-206] The tie\r\nhad a nick on the left side of the knot.[C3-207] The nick was elongated\r\nhorizontally, indicating that the tear was made by some object moving\r\nhorizontally, but the fibers were not affected in a manner which would\r\nshed light on the direction or the nature of the missile.[C3-208]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Governor\u2019s Wounds\r\n\r\nWhile riding in the right jump seat of the Presidential limousine\r\non November 22, Governor Connally sustained wounds of the back,\r\nchest, right wrist and left thigh. Because of the small size and\r\nclean-cut edges of the wound on the Governor\u2019s back, Dr. Robert Shaw\r\nconcluded that it was an entry wound.[C3-209] The bullet traversed\r\nthe Governor\u2019s chest in a downward angle, shattering his fifth rib,\r\nand exited below the right nipple.[C3-210] The ragged edges of the\r\n2-inch (5 centimeters) opening on the front of the chest led Dr. Shaw\r\nto conclude that it was the exit point of the bullet.[C3-211] When\r\nGovernor Connally testified before the Commission 5 months after\r\nthe assassination, on April 21, 1964, the Commission observed the\r\nGovernor\u2019s chest wounds, as well as the injuries to his wrist and thigh\r\nand watched Dr. Shaw measure with a caliper an angle of declination of\r\n25\u00b0 from the point of entry on the back to the point of exit on the\r\nfront of the Governor\u2019s chest.[C3-212]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the shooting, Governor Connally was unaware that he had\r\nsustained any injuries other than his chest wounds.[C3-213] On the back\r\nof his arm, about 2 inches (5 centimeters) above the wrist joint on\r\nthe thumb side, Dr. Charles F. Gregory observed a linear perforating\r\nwound approximately one-fifth of an inch (one-half centimeter) wide\r\nand 1 inch (2\u00bd centimeters) long.[C3-214] During his operation on this\r\ninjury, the doctor concluded that this ragged wound was the point of\r\nentry because thread and cloth had been carried into the wound to the\r\nregion of the bone.[C3-215] Dr. Gregory\u2019s conclusions were also based\r\nupon the location in the Governor\u2019s wrist, as revealed by X-ray, of\r\nsmall fragments of metal shed by the missile upon striking the firm\r\nsurface of the bone.[C3-216] Evidence of different amounts of air in\r\nthe tissues of the wrist gave further indication that the bullet passed\r\nfrom the back to the front of the wrist.[C3-217] An examination of the\r\npalm surface of the wrist showed a wound approximately one-fifth of\r\nan inch (one-half centimeter) long and approximately three-fourths of\r\nan inch (2 centimeters) above the crease of the right wrist.[C3-218]\r\nDr.", "start_char_idx": 267260, "end_char_idx": 271381, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17881d79-4724-4723-924b-9293733e6de3": {"__data__": {"id_": "17881d79-4724-4723-924b-9293733e6de3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a11139d-29ca-46c4-b9e2-0b9af3a9b938", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "527f421b9de4cfefe9de5a7de0ec848ec4ae35eb4f84c1b2c115145e4368d514", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4355217-bd5f-4767-81b5-c04202c9ccd0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8df6e37534b1068724c8da5b361ef0dea6444c01ca1ca0752ffde11a95faff4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C3-214] During his operation on this\r\ninjury, the doctor concluded that this ragged wound was the point of\r\nentry because thread and cloth had been carried into the wound to the\r\nregion of the bone.[C3-215] Dr. Gregory\u2019s conclusions were also based\r\nupon the location in the Governor\u2019s wrist, as revealed by X-ray, of\r\nsmall fragments of metal shed by the missile upon striking the firm\r\nsurface of the bone.[C3-216] Evidence of different amounts of air in\r\nthe tissues of the wrist gave further indication that the bullet passed\r\nfrom the back to the front of the wrist.[C3-217] An examination of the\r\npalm surface of the wrist showed a wound approximately one-fifth of\r\nan inch (one-half centimeter) long and approximately three-fourths of\r\nan inch (2 centimeters) above the crease of the right wrist.[C3-218]\r\nDr. Shaw had initially believed that the missile entered on the palm\r\nside of the Governor\u2019s wrist and exited on the back side.[C3-219]\r\nAfter reviewing the factors considered by Dr. Gregory, however, Dr.\r\nShaw withdrew his earlier opinion. He deferred to the judgment of Dr.\r\nGregory, who had more closely examined that wound during the wrist\r\noperation.[C3-220]\r\n\r\nIn addition, Governor Connally suffered a puncture wound in the left\r\nthigh that was approximately two-fifths of an inch (1 centimeter) in\r\ndiameter and located approximately 5 or 6 inches above the Governor\u2019s\r\nleft knee.[C3-221] On the Governor\u2019s leg, very little soft-tissue\r\ndamage was noted, which indicated a tangential wound or the penetration\r\nof a larger missile entering at low velocity and stopping after\r\nentering the skin.[C3-222] X-ray examination disclosed a tiny metallic\r\nfragment embedded in the Governor\u2019s leg.[C3-223] The surgeons who\r\nattended the Governor concluded that the thigh wound was not caused\r\nby the small fragment in the thigh but resulted from the impact of a\r\nlarger missile.[C3-224]\r\n\r\n_Examination of clothing._--The clothing worn by Governor Connally\r\non November 22, 1963, contained holes which matched his wounds. On\r\nthe back of the Governor\u2019s coat, a hole was found 1\u215b inches from\r\nthe seam where the right sleeve attached to the coat and 7\u00bc inches\r\nto the right of the midline.[C3-225] This hole was elongated in a\r\nhorizontal direction approximately five-eighths of an inch in length\r\nand one-fourth of an inch in height.[C3-226] The front side of the\r\nGovernor\u2019s coat contained a circular hole three-eighths of an inch in\r\ndiameter, located 5 inches to the right of the front right edge of the\r\ncoat slightly above the top button.[C3-227] A rough hole approximately\r\nfive-eighths of an inch in length and three-eighths of an inch in width\r\nwas found near the end of the right sleeve.[C3-228] Each of these holes\r\ncould have been caused by a bullet, but a positive determination of\r\nthis fact or the direction of the missile was not possible because the\r\ngarment had been cleaned and pressed prior to any opportunity for a\r\nscientific examination.[C3-229]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the Governor\u2019s shirt disclosed a very ragged tear\r\nfive-eighths of an inch long horizontally and one-half of an inch\r\nvertically on the back of the shirt near the right sleeve 2 inches\r\nfrom the line where the sleeve attaches.[C3-230] Immediately to the\r\nright was another small tear, approximately three-sixteenths of an inch\r\nlong.[C3-231] The two holes corresponded in position to the hole in\r\nthe back of the Governor\u2019s coat.[C3-232] A very irregular tear in the\r\nform of an \u201cH\u201d was observed on the front side of the Governor\u2019s shirt,\r\napproximately 1\u00bd inches high, with a crossbar tear approximately 1 inch\r\nwide, located 5 inches from the right side seam and 9 inches from the\r\ntop of the right sleeve.[C3-233] Because the shirt had been laundered,\r\nthere were insufficient characteristics for the expert examiner to form\r\na conclusive opinion on the direction or nature of the object causing\r\nthe holes.[C3-234] The rear hole could have been caused by the entrance\r\nof a 6.5-millimeter bullet and the front hole by the exit of such a\r\nbullet.",

inches high, with a crossbar tear approximately 1 inch\r\nwide, located 5 inches from the right side seam and 9 inches from the\r\ntop of the right sleeve.[C3-233] Because the shirt had been laundered,\r\nthere were insufficient characteristics for the expert examiner to form\r\na conclusive opinion on the direction or nature of the object causing\r\nthe holes.[C3-234] The rear hole could have been caused by the entrance\r\nof a 6.5-millimeter bullet and the front hole by the exit of such a\r\nbullet.[C3-235]\r\n\r\nOn the French cuff of the right sleeve of the Governor\u2019s shirt was\r\na ragged, irregularly shaped hole located 1\u00bd inches from the end of\r\nthe sleeve and 5\u00bd inches from the outside cuff-link hole.[C3-236] The\r\ncharacteristics after laundering did not permit positive conclusions\r\nbut these holes could have been caused by a bullet passing through the\r\nGovernor\u2019s right wrist from the back to the front sides.[C3-237] The\r\nGovernor\u2019s trousers contained a hole approximately one-fourth of an\r\ninch in diameter in the region of the left knee.[C3-238] The roughly\r\ncircular shape of the hole and the slight tearing away from the edges\r\ngave the hole the general appearance of a bullet hole but it was not\r\npossible to determine the direction of the missile which caused the\r\nhole.[C3-239]\r\n\r\n_Course of bullet._--Ballistics experiments and medical findings\r\nestablished that the missile which passed through the Governor\u2019s wrist\r\nand penetrated his thigh had first traversed his chest. The Army Wound\r\nBallistics experts conducted tests which proved that the Governor\u2019s\r\nwrist wound was not caused by a pristine bullet. (See app. X, pp.\r\n582-585.) A bullet is pristine immediately on exiting from a rifle\r\nmuzzle when it moves in a straight line with a spinning motion and\r\nmaintains its uniform trajectory with but a minimum of nose surface\r\nstriking the air through which it passes.[C3-240] When the straight\r\nline of flight of a bullet is deflected by striking some object, it\r\nstarts to wobble or become irregular in flight, a condition called\r\nyaw.[C3-241] A bullet with yaw has a greater surface exposed to the\r\nstriking material or air, since the target or air is struck not only\r\nby the nose of the bullet, its smallest striking surface, but also by\r\nthe bullet\u2019s sides.[C3-242]\r\n\r\nThe ballistics experts learned the exact nature of the Governor\u2019s wrist\r\nwound by examining Parkland Hospital records and X-rays and conferring\r\nwith Dr. Gregory. The C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the\r\nDepository was fired with bullets of the same type as the bullet found\r\non the Governor\u2019s stretcher and the fragments found in the Presidential\r\nlimousine. Shots were fired from a distance of 70 yards at comparable\r\nflesh and bone protected by material similar to the clothing worn by\r\nthe Governor.[C3-243] One of the test shots wounded the comparable\r\nflesh and bone structure in virtually the same place and from the same\r\nangle as the wound inflicted on Governor Connally\u2019s wrist. An X-ray and\r\nphotograph of the simulated wrist confirmed the similarity.[C3-244] The\r\nbullet which inflicted that injury during the tests had a nose which\r\nwas substantially flattened from striking the material.[C3-245] The\r\nstriking velocity at 70 yards of seven shots fired during the tests\r\naveraged 1,858 feet per second; the average exit velocity of five shots\r\nwas 1,776 feet per second.", "start_char_idx": 273898, "end_char_idx": 277501, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c910e371-389d-44fb-94eb-1878fb0e14a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "c910e371-389d-44fb-94eb-1878fb0e14a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4355217-bd5f-4767-81b5-c04202c9ccd0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "ae3be0cf4bbb81b5fb5db3e8de655455aedfd1ff374c6d9fffffc230ea639c1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "31bebe68-23d2-4c6a-bdef-2adf3a2357ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "510af343fa4cb3c64d22d8d13251c50974773260e87216648fae56dae89ce594", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Shots were fired from a distance of 70 yards at comparable\r\nflesh and bone protected by material similar to the clothing worn by\r\nthe Governor.[C3-243] One of the test shots wounded the comparable\r\nflesh and bone structure in virtually the same place and from the same\r\nangle as the wound inflicted on Governor Connally\u2019s wrist.

The weight of the whole\r\nbullet prior to firing was approximately 160-161 grains and that of the\r\nrecovered bullet was 158.6 grains.[C3-253] An X-ray of the Governor\u2019s\r\nwrist showed very minute metallic fragments, and two or three of these\r\nfragments were removed from his wrist.[C3-254] All these fragments were\r\nsufficiently small and light so that the nearly whole bullet found on\r\nthe stretcher could have deposited those pieces of metal as it tumbled\r\nthrough his wrist.[C3-255] In their testimony, the three doctors who\r\nattended Governor Connally at Parkland Hospital expressed independently\r\ntheir opinion that a single bullet had passed through his chest;\r\ntumbled through his wrist with very little exit velocity, leaving small\r\nmetallic fragments from the rear portion of the bullet; punctured his\r\nleft thigh after the bullet had lost virtually all of its velocity; and\r\nhad fallen out of the thigh wound.[C3-256]\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally himself thought it likely that all his wounds were\r\ncaused by a single bullet.

In order to determine the facts with as much\r\nprecision as possible and to insure that all data were consistent\r\nwith the shots having been fired from the sixth floor window, the\r\nCommission requested additional investigation, including the analysis\r\nof motion picture films of the assassination and onsite tests. The\r\nfacts developed through this investigation by the FBI and Secret\r\nService confirmed the conclusions reached by the Commission regarding\r\nthe source and trajectory of the shots which hit the President and the\r\nGovernor. Moreover, these facts enabled the Commission to make certain\r\napproximations regarding the locations of the Presidential limousine at\r\nthe time of the shots and the relevant time intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFilms and Tests\r\n\r\nWhen the shots rang out the Presidential limousine was moving beyond\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository Building in a southwesterly direction\r\non Elm Street between Houston Street and the Triple Underpass.[C3-260]\r\nThe general location of the car was described and marked on maps by\r\neyewitnesses as precisely as their observations and recollections\r\npermitted.[C3-261] More exact information was provided by motion\r\npictures taken by Abraham Zapruder, Orville O. Nix and Mary Muchmore,\r\nwho were spectators at the scene.[C3-262] Substantial light has been\r\nshed on the assassination sequence by viewing these motion pictures,\r\nparticularly the Zapruder film, which was the most complete and from\r\nwhich individual 35-millimeter slides were made of each motion picture\r\nframe.[C3-263]\r\n\r\nExamination of the Zapruder motion picture camera by the FBI\r\nestablished that 18.3 pictures or frames were taken each second,\r\nand therefore, the timing of certain events could be calculated by\r\nallowing 1/18.3 seconds for the action depicted from one frame to the\r\nnext.[C3-264] The films and slides made from individual frames were\r\nviewed by Governor and Mrs. Connally, the Governor\u2019s doctors, the\r\nautopsy surgeons, and the Army wound ballistics scientists in order\r\nto apply the knowledge of each to determine the precise course of\r\nevents.[C3-265] Tests of the assassin\u2019s rifle disclosed that at least\r\n2.3 seconds were required between shots.[C3-266] In evaluating the\r\nfilms in the light of these timing guides, it was kept in mind that\r\na victim of a bullet wound may not react immediately and, in some\r\nsituations, according to experts, the victim may not even know where he\r\nhas been hit, or when.[C3-267]\r\n\r\nOn May 24, 1964, agents of the FBI and Secret Service conducted a\r\nseries of tests to determine as precisely as possible what happened\r\non November 22, 1963. Since the Presidential limousine was being\r\nremodeled and was therefore unavailable, it was simulated by using\r\nthe Secret Service followup car, which is similar in design.[C3-268]\r\nAny differences were taken into account.

The President was in clear view of the assassin as he rode up\r\nHouston Street and for 100 feet as he proceeded down Elm Street, until\r\nhe came to a point denoted as frame 166 on the Zapruder film.[C3-274]\r\nThese facts were determined in the test by placing the car and men\r\non Elm Street in the exact spot where they were when each frame of\r\nthe Zapruder film was photographed. To pinpoint their locations, a\r\nman stood at Zapruder\u2019s position and directed the automobile and both\r\nmodels to the positions shown on each frame, after which a Bureau\r\nphotographer crouched at the sixth-floor window and looked through a\r\ncamera whose lens recorded the view through the telescopic sight of the\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.[C3-275] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n887, p. 99.) Each position was measured to determine how far President\r\nKennedy had gone down Elm from a point, which was designated as station\r\nC, on a line drawn along the west curbline of Houston Street.[C3-276]\r\n\r\nBased on these calculations, the agents concluded that at frame 166 of\r\nthe Zapruder film the President passed beneath the foliage of the large\r\noak tree and the point of impact on the President\u2019s back disappeared\r\nfrom the gunman\u2019s view as seen through the telescopic lens.[C3-277]\r\n(See Commission Exhibit No. 889, p. 100.)

However, the assassin continued to\r\nhave a clear view of the President as he proceeded down Elm.[C3-282]\r\nWhen President Kennedy again came fully into view in the Zapruder film\r\nat frame 225, he seemed to be reacting to his neck wound by raising\r\nhis hands to his throat.[C3-283] (See Commission Exhibit No. 895, p.\r\n103.) According to Shaneyfelt the reaction was \u201cclearly apparent in 226\r\nand barely apparent in 225.\u201d[C3-284] It is probable that the President\r\nwas not shot before frame 210, since it is unlikely that the assassin\r\nwould deliberately have shot at him with a view obstructed by the oak\r\ntree when he was about to have a clear opportunity. It is also doubtful\r\nthat even the most proficient marksman would have hit him through the\r\noak tree. In addition, the President\u2019s reaction is \u201cbarely apparent\u201d\r\nin frame 225, which is 15 frames or approximately eight-tenths second\r\nafter frame 210, and a shot much before 210 would assume a longer\r\nreaction time than was recalled by eyewitnesses at the scene. Thus,\r\nthe evidence indicated that the President was not hit until at least\r\nframe 210 and that he was probably hit by frame 225. The possibility\r\nof variations in reaction time in addition to the obstruction of\r\nZapruder\u2019s view by the sign precluded a more specific determination\r\nthan that the President was probably shot through the neck between\r\nframes 210 and 225, which marked his position between 138.9 and 153.8\r\nfeet west of station C.[C3-285]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 887\r\n\r\nPhotograph taken during reenactment showing C2766 rifle with camera\r\nattached.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 889\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 166]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 891\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 186]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 893\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 210]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 895\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 225]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 697\r\n\r\nPhotograph of Presidential limousine taken during motorcade.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Special Agent Robert A.

Since it did not hit the automobile, Frazier\r\ntestified that it probably struck Governor Connally.[C3-292] The\r\nrelative positions of President Kennedy and Governor Connally at\r\nthe time when the President was struck in the neck confirm that the\r\nsame bullet probably passed through both men. Pictures taken of the\r\nPresident\u2019s limousine on November 22, 1963, showed that the Governor\r\nsat immediately in front of the President.[C3-293] Even though the\r\nprecise distance cannot be ascertained, it is apparent that President\r\nKennedy was somewhat to the Governor\u2019s right. The President sat on the\r\nextreme right, as noted in the films and by eyewitnesses, while the\r\nright edge of the jump seat in which the Governor sat is 6 inches from\r\nthe right door.[C3-294] (See Commission Exhibit No. 697, p. 104.) The\r\nPresident wore a back brace which tended to make him sit up straight,\r\nand the Governor also sat erect since the jump seat gave him little leg\r\nroom.[C3-295]\r\n\r\nBased on his observations during the reenactment and the position of\r\nGovernor Connally shown in the Zapruder film after the car emerged\r\nfrom behind the sign, Frazier testified that Governor Connally was in\r\na position during the span from frame 207 to frame 225 to receive a\r\nbullet which would have caused the wounds he actually suffered.[C3-296]\r\nGovernor Connally viewed the film and testified that he was hit between\r\nframes 231 and 234.[C3-297] According to Frazier, between frames 235\r\nand 240 the Governor turned sharply to his right, so that by frame\r\n240 he was too far to the right to have received his injuries at that\r\ntime.[C3-298] At some point between frames 235 and 240, therefore,\r\nis the last occasion when Governor Connally could have received his\r\ninjuries, since in the frames following 240 he remained turned too\r\nfar to his right.", "start_char_idx": 290295, "end_char_idx": 294013, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33c41faf-5c56-430d-9b6f-c5d5966386c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "33c41faf-5c56-430d-9b6f-c5d5966386c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "89689392-0e92-4ee8-b70b-97d114870c13", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "b4ce38c203b80d85f83d218b6d0a36559002160e9183e0a3bb1be226cb88230c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9aa48004-5e2b-4a6b-9d4d-46662568c2b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "70cfd1eb02e877bf28b5c7dcaa0a6932453556563679bc268d6f6e9a3e271d32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C3-296]\r\nGovernor Connally viewed the film and testified that he was hit between\r\nframes 231 and 234.[C3-297] According to Frazier, between frames 235\r\nand 240 the Governor turned sharply to his right, so that by frame\r\n240 he was too far to the right to have received his injuries at that\r\ntime.[C3-298] At some point between frames 235 and 240, therefore,\r\nis the last occasion when Governor Connally could have received his\r\ninjuries, since in the frames following 240 he remained turned too\r\nfar to his right.[C3-299] If Governor Connally was hit by a separate\r\nshot between frames 235 and 240 which followed the shot which hit the\r\nPresident\u2019s neck, it would follow that: (1) the assassin\u2019s first shot,\r\nassuming a minimum firing time of 2.3 seconds (or 42 frames), was fired\r\nbetween frames 193 and 198 when his view was obscured by the oak tree;\r\n(2) President Kennedy continued waving to the crowd after he was hit\r\nand did not begin to react for about 1\u00bd seconds; and (3) the first\r\nshot, although hitting no bones in the President\u2019s body, was deflected\r\nafter its exit from the President\u2019s neck in such a way that it failed\r\nto hit either the automobile or any of the other occupants.\r\n\r\nViewed through the telescopic sight of the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano\r\nrifle from the sixth-floor window during the test, the marks that\r\nsimulated the entry wounds on the stand-ins for the President and the\r\nGovernor were generally in a straight line. That alinement became\r\nobvious to the viewer through the scope as the Governor\u2019s model\r\nturned slightly to his right and assumed the position which Governor\r\nConnally had described as his position when he was struck. Viewing\r\nthe stand-ins for the President and the Governor in the sight of the\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle at the location depicted in frames\r\n207 and 210, Frazier testified: \u201cThey both are in direct alinement\r\nwith the telescopic sight at the window. The Governor is immediately\r\nbehind the President in the field of view.\u201d[C3-300] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 893, p. 102.) A surveyor then placed his sighting equipment\r\nat the precise point of entry on the back of the President\u2019s neck,\r\nassuming that the President was struck at frame 210, and measured the\r\nangle to the end of the muzzle of the rifle positioned where it was\r\nbelieved to have been held by the assassin.[C3-301] That angle measured\r\n21\u00b034\u2019.[C3-302] From the same points of reference, the angle at frame\r\n225 was measured at 20\u00b011\u2019, giving an average angle of 20\u00b052\u201930\u201d from\r\nframe 210 to frame 225.[C3-303] Allowing for a downward street grade of\r\n3\u00b09\u2019, the probable angle through the President\u2019s body was calculated at\r\n17\u00b043\u201930\u201d, assuming that he was sitting in a vertical position.[C3-304]\r\n\r\nThat angle was consistent with the trajectory of a bullet passing\r\nthrough the President\u2019s neck and then striking Governor Connally\u2019s\r\nback, causing the wounds which were discussed above. Shortly after\r\nthat angle was ascertained, the open car and the stand-ins were\r\ntaken by the agents to a nearby garage where a photograph was taken\r\nto determine through closer study whether the angle of that shot\r\ncould have accounted for the wounds in the President\u2019s neck and the\r\nGovernor\u2019s back.[C3-305] A rod was placed at an angle of 17\u00b043\u201930\u201d next\r\nto the stand-ins for the President and the Governor, who were seated in\r\nthe same relative positions.[C3-306] The wounds of entry and exit on\r\nthe President were approximated based on information gained from the\r\nautopsy reports and photographs.[C3-307] The hole in the back of the\r\njacket worn by the Governor and the medical description of the wound\r\non his back marked that entry point.[C3-308] That line of fire from\r\nthe sixth floor of the Depository would have caused the bullet to exit\r\nunder the Governor\u2019s right nipple just as the bullet did.

In addition, the angle could not be fixed with absolute\r\nprecision, since the large wound on the front of his chest precluded an\r\nexact determination of the point of exit.[C3-310]\r\n\r\nThe alinement of the points of entry was only indicative and not\r\nconclusive that one bullet hit both men. The exact positions of\r\nthe men could not be re-created; thus, the angle could only be\r\napproximated.[C3-311] Had President Kennedy been leaning forward or\r\nbackward, the angle of declination of the shot to a perpendicular\r\ntarget would have varied. The angle of 17\u00b043\u201930\u201d was approximately\r\nthe angle of declination reproduced in an artist\u2019s drawing.[C3-312]\r\nThat drawing, made from data provided by the autopsy surgeons, could\r\nnot reproduce the exact line of the bullet, since the exit wound\r\nwas obliterated by the tracheotomy. Similarly, if the President or\r\nthe Governor had been sitting in a different lateral position, the\r\nconclusion might have varied. Or if the Governor had not turned in\r\nexactly the way calculated, the alinement would have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nAdditional experiments by the Army Wound Ballistics Branch further\r\nsuggested that the same bullet probably passed through both President\r\nKennedy and Governor Connally. (See app. X, pp. 582-585.) Correlation\r\nof a test simulating the Governor\u2019s chest wound with the neck and\r\nwrist experiments indicated that course. After reviewing the Parkland\r\nHospital medical records and X-rays of the Governor and discussing his\r\nchest injury with the attending surgeon, the Army ballistics experts\r\nvirtually duplicated the wound using the assassination weapon and\r\nanimal flesh covered by cloth.[C3-313] The bullet that struck the\r\nanimal flesh displayed characteristics similar to the bullet found on\r\nGovernor Connally\u2019s stretcher.[C3-314] Moreover, the imprint on the\r\nvelocity screen immediately behind the animal flesh showed that the\r\nbullet was tumbling after exiting from the flesh, having lost a total\r\naverage of 265 feet per second.[C3-315] Taking into consideration the\r\nGovernor\u2019s size, the reduction in velocity of a bullet passing through\r\nhis body would be approximately 400 feet per second.[C3-316]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 902\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM NIX FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 313\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM MUCHMORE FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT]\r\n\r\nBased upon the medical evidence on the wounds of the Governor and\r\nthe President and the wound ballistics tests performed at Edgewood\r\nArsenal, Drs.

Dziemian and Olivier believed that\r\nthe wound on the Governor\u2019s wrist would have been more extensive had\r\nthe bullet which inflicted that injury merely passed through the\r\nGovernor\u2019s chest, exiting at a velocity of approximately 1,500 feet per\r\nsecond.[C3-319] Thus, the Governor\u2019s wrist wound suggested that the\r\nbullet passed through the President\u2019s neck, began to yaw in the air\r\nbetween the President and the Governor, and then lost more velocity\r\nthan 400 feet per second in passing through the Governor\u2019s chest. A\r\nbullet which was yawing on entering into the Governor\u2019s back would\r\nlose substantially more velocity in passing through his body than\r\na pristine bullet.[C3-320] In addition, the bullet that struck the\r\nanimal flesh was flattened to a greater extent than the bullet which\r\npresumably struck the Governor\u2019s rib,[C3-321] which suggests that the\r\nbullet which entered the Governor\u2019s chest had already lost velocity\r\nby passing through the President\u2019s neck. Moreover, the large wound on\r\nthe Governor\u2019s back would be explained by a bullet which was yawing,\r\nalthough that type of wound might also be accounted for by a tangential\r\nstriking.[C3-322]\r\n\r\nDr. Frederick W. Light, Jr., the third of the wound ballistics experts,\r\nwho has been engaged in that specialty at Edgewood Arsenal since 1951,\r\ntestified that the anatomical findings were insufficient for him to\r\nformulate a firm opinion as to whether the same bullet did or did not\r\npass through the President\u2019s neck first before inflicting all the\r\nwounds on Governor Connally.[C3-323] Based on the other circumstances,\r\nsuch as the relative positions of the President and the Governor in\r\nthe automobile, Dr. Light concluded that it was probable that the same\r\nbullet traversed the President\u2019s neck and inflicted all the wounds on\r\nGovernor Connally.[C3-324]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Subsequent Bullet That Hit\r\n\r\nAfter a bullet penetrated President Kennedy\u2019s neck, a subsequent shot\r\nentered the back of his head and exited through the upper right portion\r\nof his skull. The Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore films show the instant in\r\nthe sequence when that bullet struck. (See Commission Exhibit No. 902,\r\np. 108.) That impact was evident from the explosion of the President\u2019s\r\nbrain tissues from the right side of his head. The immediately\r\npreceding frame from the Zapruder film shows the President slumped to\r\nhis left, clutching at his throat, with his chin close to his chest and\r\nhis head tilted forward at an angle.[C3-325] Based upon information\r\nprovided by the doctors who conducted the autopsy, an artist\u2019s drawing\r\ndepicted the path of the bullet through the President\u2019s head, with his\r\nhead being in the same approximate position.[C3-326]\r\n\r\nBy using the Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore motion pictures, the\r\nPresident\u2019s location at the time the bullet penetrated his head was\r\nfixed with reasonable precision. A careful analysis of the Nix and\r\nMuchmore films led to fixing the exact location of these cameramen. The\r\npoint of impact of the bullet on the President\u2019s head was apparent in\r\nall of the movies. At that point in the Nix film a straight line was\r\nplotted from the camera position to a fixed point in the background\r\nand the President\u2019s location along this line was marked on a plat\r\nmap.[C3-327] A similar process was followed with the Muchmore film. The\r\nPresident\u2019s location on the plat map was identical to that determined\r\nfrom the Nix film.[C3-328] The President\u2019s location, established\r\nthrough the Nix and Muchmore films, was confirmed by comparing his\r\nposition on the Zapruder film.

This location had hitherto only been\r\napproximated, since there were no landmarks in the background of the\r\nZapruder frame for alinement purposes other than a portion of a painted\r\nline on the curb.[C3-329] Through these procedures, it was determined\r\nthat President Kennedy was shot in the head when he was 230.8 feet from\r\na point on the west curbline on Houston Street where it intersected\r\nwith Elm Street.[C3-330] The President was 265.3 feet from the rifle in\r\nthe sixth-floor window and at that position the approximate angle of\r\ndeclination was 15\u00b021\u2019.[C3-331]\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF SHOTS\r\n\r\nThe consensus among the witnesses at the scene was that three shots\r\nwere fired.[C3-332] However, some heard only two shots,[C3-333] while\r\nothers testified that they heard four and perhaps as many as five\r\nor six shots.[C3-334] The difficulty of accurate perception of the\r\nsound of gunshots required careful scrutiny of all of this testimony\r\nregarding the number of shots. The firing of a bullet causes a number\r\nof noises: the muzzle blast, caused by the smashing of the hot gases\r\nwhich propel the bullet into the relatively stable air at the gun\u2019s\r\nmuzzle; the noise of the bullet, caused by the shock wave built up\r\nahead of the bullet\u2019s nose as it travels through the air; and the noise\r\ncaused by the impact of the bullet on its target.[C3-335] Each noise\r\ncan be quite sharp and may be perceived as a separate shot. The tall\r\nbuildings in the area might have further distorted the sound.\r\n\r\nThe physical and other evidence examined by the Commission compels\r\nthe conclusion that at least two shots were fired. As discussed\r\npreviously, the nearly whole bullet discovered at Parkland Hospital\r\nand the two larger fragments found in the Presidential automobile,\r\nwhich were identified as coming from the assassination rifle, came from\r\nat least two separate bullets and possibly from three.[C3-336] The\r\nmost convincing evidence relating to the number of shots was provided\r\nby the presence on the sixth floor of three spent cartridges which\r\nwere demonstrated to have been fired by the same rifle that fired the\r\nbullets which caused the wounds. It is possible that the assassin\r\ncarried an empty shell in the rifle and fired only two shots, with the\r\nwitnesses hearing multiple noises made by the same shot. Soon after\r\nthe three empty cartridges were found, officials at the scene decided\r\nthat three shots were fired, and that conclusion was widely circulated\r\nby the press. The eyewitness testimony may be subconsciously colored\r\nby the extensive publicity given the conclusion that three shots were\r\nfired. Nevertheless, the preponderance of the evidence, in particular\r\nthe three spent cartridges, led the Commission to conclude that there\r\nwere three shots fired.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHOT THAT MISSED\r\n\r\nFrom the initial findings that (_a_) one shot passed through the\r\nPresident\u2019s neck and then most probably passed through the Governor\u2019s\r\nbody, (_b_) a subsequent shot penetrated the President\u2019s head, (_c_)\r\nno other shot struck any part of the automobile, and (_d_) three shots\r\nwere fired, it follows that one shot probably missed the car and its\r\noccupants. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether it was the first,\r\nsecond, or third shot which missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Shot\r\n\r\nIf the first shot missed, the assassin perhaps missed in an effort to\r\nfire a hurried shot before the President passed under the oak tree, or\r\npossibly he fired as the President passed under the tree and the tree\r\nobstructed his view. The bullet might have struck a portion of the tree\r\nand been completely deflected. On the other hand, the greatest cause\r\nfor doubt that the first shot missed is the improbability that the\r\nsame marksman who twice hit a moving target would be so inaccurate on\r\nthe first and closest of his shots as to miss completely, not only the\r\ntarget, but the large automobile.", "start_char_idx": 303777, "end_char_idx": 308252, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7776368c-3d74-4909-9c6e-e89e115289e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "7776368c-3d74-4909-9c6e-e89e115289e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c74630b0-4242-4bda-9bfb-5eccd93e0650", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "48f6eb2984d4e8354cc3c4771ca0236afca8556ff9cfd254b8436243af712afc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d7d64600-6e4d-449e-9a56-8f48a3d2fddc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50190f409c505c02e68497847dfa3f8816e755e01681985958c50603498799f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The evidence is inconclusive as to whether it was the first,\r\nsecond, or third shot which missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Shot\r\n\r\nIf the first shot missed, the assassin perhaps missed in an effort to\r\nfire a hurried shot before the President passed under the oak tree, or\r\npossibly he fired as the President passed under the tree and the tree\r\nobstructed his view.

Although his\r\nformal statement was dated November 23, 1963, his notes indicate that\r\nhe recorded what he saw and heard at 5:30 p.m., November 22, 1963, on\r\nthe airplane en route back to Washington, prior to the autopsy, when it\r\nwas not yet known that the President had been hit in the back.[C3-338]\r\nIt is possible, of course, that Bennett did not observe the hole in\r\nthe President\u2019s back, which might have been there immediately after the\r\nfirst noise.\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally\u2019s testimony supports the view that the first shot\r\nmissed, because he stated that he heard a shot, turned slightly to his\r\nright, and, as he started to turn back toward his left, was struck\r\nby the second bullet.[C3-339] He never saw the President during the\r\nshooting sequence, and it is entirely possible that he heard the missed\r\nshot and that both men were struck by the second bullet. Mrs. Connally\r\ntestified that after the first shot she turned and saw the President\u2019s\r\nhands moving toward his throat, as seen in the films at frame\r\n225.[C3-340] However, Mrs. Connally further stated that she thought her\r\nhusband was hit immediately thereafter by the second bullet.[C3-341]\r\nIf the same bullet struck both the President and the Governor, it is\r\nentirely possible that she saw the President\u2019s movements at the same\r\ntime as she heard the second shot. Her testimony, therefore, does not\r\npreclude the possibility of the first shot having missed.\r\n\r\nOther eyewitness testimony, however, supports the conclusion that the\r\nfirst of the shots fired hit the President. As discussed in chapter II,\r\nSpecial Agent Hill\u2019s testimony indicates that the President was hit by\r\nthe first shot and that the head injury was caused by a second shot\r\nwhich followed about 5 seconds later. James W. Altgens, a photographer\r\nin Dallas for the Associated Press, had stationed himself on Elm Street\r\nopposite the Depository to take pictures of the passing motorcade.\r\nAltgens took a widely circulated photograph which showed President\r\nKennedy reacting to the first of the two shots which hit him. (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 900, p. 113.) According to Altgens, he snapped\r\nthe picture \u201calmost simultaneously\u201d with a shot which he is confident\r\nwas the first one fired.[C3-342] Comparison of his photograph with\r\nthe Zapruder film, however, revealed that Altgens took his picture\r\nat approximately the same moment as frame 255 of the movie, 30 to\r\n45 frames (approximately 2 seconds) later than the point at which\r\nthe President was shot in the neck.[C3-343] (See Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 901, p. 114.) Another photographer, Phillip L. Willis, snapped\r\na picture at a time which he also asserts was simultaneous with the\r\nfirst shot. Analysis of his photograph revealed that it was taken at\r\napproximately frame 210 of the Zapruder film, which was the approximate\r\ntime of the shot that probably hit the President and the Governor.

There was,\r\nconceivably, a delayed reaction between the time the bullet struck him\r\nand the time he realized that he was hit, despite the fact that the\r\nbullet struck a glancing blow to a rib and penetrated his wrist bone.\r\nThe Governor did not even know that he had been struck in the wrist or\r\nin the thigh until he regained consciousness in the hospital the next\r\nday.

From the timing\r\nevidenced by the Zapruder films, there was an interval of from 4.8 to\r\n5.6 seconds between the shot which struck President Kennedy\u2019s neck\r\n(between frames 210 to 225) and the shot which struck his head at frame\r\n313.[C3-346] Since a minimum of 2.3 seconds must elapse between shots,\r\na bullet could have been fired from the rifle and missed during this\r\ninterval.[C3-347] This possibility was buttressed by the testimony of\r\nwitnesses who claimed that the shots were evenly spaced, since a second\r\nshot occurring within an interval of approximately 5 seconds would have\r\nto be almost exactly midway in this period. If Altgens\u2019 recollection\r\nis correct that he snapped his picture at the same moment as he heard\r\na shot, then it is possible that he heard a second shot which missed,\r\nsince a shot fired 2.3 seconds before he took his picture at frame 255\r\ncould have hit the President at about frame 213.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a substantial majority of the witnesses stated that\r\nthe shots were not evenly spaced. Most witnesses recalled that the\r\nsecond and third shots were bunched together, although some believed\r\nthat it was the first and second which were bunched.[C3-348] To the\r\nextent that reliance can be placed on recollection of witnesses as to\r\nthe spacing of the shots, the testimony that the shots were not evenly\r\nspaced would militate against a second shot missing. Another factor\r\narguing against the second shot missing is that the gunman would have\r\nbeen shooting at very near the minimum allowable time to have fired\r\nthe three shots within 4.8 to 5.6 seconds, although it was entirely\r\npossible for him to have done so. (See ch. IV, pp. 188-194.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Third Shot\r\n\r\nThe last possibility, of course, is that it was the third shot which\r\nmissed.

The limousine also changed\r\ndirection by following the curve to the right, whereas previously it\r\nhad been proceeding in almost a straight line with a rifle protruding\r\nfrom the sixth-floor window of the Depository Building.\r\n\r\nOne must consider, however, the testimony of the witnesses who\r\ndescribed the head shot as the concluding event in the assassination\r\nsequence. Illustrative is the testimony of Associated Press\r\nphotographer Altgens, who had an excellent vantage point near the\r\nPresident\u2019s car. He recalled that the shot which hit the President\u2019s\r\nhead \u201cwas the last shot--that much I will say with a great degree\r\nof certainty.\u201d[C3-349] On the other hand, Emmett J. Hudson, the\r\ngroundskeeper of Dealey Plaza, testified that from his position on\r\nElm Street, midway between Houston Street and the Triple Underpass,\r\nhe heard a third shot after the shot which hit the President in the\r\nhead.[C3-350] In addition, Mrs. Kennedy\u2019s testimony indicated that\r\nneither the first nor the second shot missed. Immediately after the\r\nfirst noise she turned, because of the Governor\u2019s yell, and saw her\r\nhusband raise his hand to his forehead. Then the second shot struck the\r\nPresident\u2019s head.[C3-351]\r\n\r\nSome evidence suggested that a third shot may have entirely missed and\r\nhit the turf or street by the Triple Underpass. Royce G. Skelton, who\r\nwatched the motorcade from the railroad bridge, testified that after\r\ntwo shots \u201cthe car came on down close to the Triple Underpass\u201d and an\r\nadditional shot \u201chit in the left front of the President\u2019s car on the\r\ncement.\u201d[C3-352] Skelton thought that there had been a total of four\r\nshots, either the third or fourth of which hit in the vicinity of the\r\nunderpass.[C3-353] Dallas Patrolman J.\u00a0W. Foster, who was also on the\r\nTriple Underpass, testified that a shot hit the turf near a manhole\r\ncover in the vicinity of the underpass.[C3-354] Examination of this\r\narea, however, disclosed no indication that a bullet struck at the\r\nlocations indicated by Skelton or Foster.[C3-355]\r\n\r\nAt a different location in Dealey Plaza, the evidence indicated that a\r\nbullet fragment did hit the street. James T. Tague, who got out of his\r\ncar to watch the motorcade from a position between Commerce and Main\r\nStreets near the Triple Underpass, was hit on the cheek by an object\r\nduring the shooting.[C3-356] Within a few minutes Tague reported this\r\nto Deputy Sheriff Eddy R. Walthers, who was examining the area to\r\nsee if any bullets had struck the turf.[C3-357] Walthers immediately\r\nstarted to search where Tague had been standing and located a place on\r\nthe south curb of Main Street where it appeared a bullet had hit the\r\ncement.[C3-358] According to Tague, \u201cThere was a mark quite obviously\r\nthat was a bullet, and it was very fresh.\u201d[C3-359] In Tague\u2019s opinion,\r\nit was the second shot which caused the mark, since he thinks he heard\r\nthe third shot after he was hit in the face.[C3-360] This incident\r\nappears to have been recorded in the contemporaneous report of Dallas\r\nPatrolman L.\u00a0L.

Nevertheless, the preponderance of the eyewitness\r\ntestimony that the head shot was the final shot must be weighed in any\r\ndetermination as to whether it was the third shot that missed. Even\r\nif it were caused by a bullet fragment, the mark on the south curb of\r\nMain Street cannot be identified conclusively with any of the three\r\nshots fired. Under the circumstances it might have come from the bullet\r\nwhich hit the President\u2019s head, or it might have been a product of the\r\nfragmentation of the missed shot upon hitting some other object in the\r\narea.[C3-364] Since he did not observe any of the shots striking the\r\nPresident, Tague\u2019s testimony that the second shot, rather than the\r\nthird, caused the scratch on his cheek, does not assist in limiting the\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of possibilities and the existence of conflicting\r\ntestimony, when coupled with the impossibility of scientific\r\nverification, precludes a conclusive finding by the Commission as to\r\nwhich shot missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME SPAN OF SHOTS\r\n\r\nWitnesses at the assassination scene said that the shots were\r\nfired within a few seconds, with the general estimate being 5 to 6\r\nseconds.[C3-365] That approximation was most probably based on the\r\nearlier publicized reports that the first shot struck the President in\r\nthe neck, the second wounded the Governor and the third shattered the\r\nPresident\u2019s head, with the time span from the neck to the head shots on\r\nthe President being approximately 5 seconds. As previously indicated,\r\nthe time span between the shot entering the back of the President\u2019s\r\nneck and the bullet which shattered his skull was 4.8 to 5.6 seconds.\r\nIf the second shot missed, then 4.8 to 5.6 seconds was the total time\r\nspan of the shots.

Two\r\nbullets probably caused all the wounds suffered by President Kennedy\r\nand Governor Connally. Since the preponderance of the evidence\r\nindicated that three shots were fired, the Commission concluded that\r\none shot probably missed the Presidential limousine and its occupants,\r\nand that the three shots were fired in a time period ranging from\r\napproximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Assassin\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapter has established that the bullets which killed\r\nPresident Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired from the\r\nsoutheast corner window of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building and that the weapon which fired these bullets was\r\na Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle bearing the serial\r\nnumber C2766. In this chapter the Commission evaluates the evidence\r\nupon which it has based its conclusion concerning the identity of the\r\nassassin. This evidence includes (1) the ownership and possession of\r\nthe weapon used to commit the assassination, (2) the means by which the\r\nweapon was brought into the Depository Building, (3) the identity of\r\nthe person present at the window from which the shots were fired, (4)\r\nthe killing of Dallas Patrolman J.D. Tippit within 45 minutes after the\r\nassassination, (5) the resistance to arrest and the attempted shooting\r\nof another police officer by the man (Lee Harvey Oswald) subsequently\r\naccused of assassinating President Kennedy and killing Patrolman\r\nTippit, (6) the lies told to the police by Oswald, (7) the evidence\r\nlinking Oswald to the attempted killing of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n(Resigned, U.S. Army) on April 10, 1963, and (8) Oswald\u2019s capability\r\nwith a rifle.\r\n\r\n\r\nOWNERSHIP AND POSSESSION OF ASSASSINATION WEAPON\r\n\r\nPurchase of Rifle by Oswald\r\n\r\nShortly after the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was found on the sixth floor\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository Building,[C4-1] agents of the FBI\r\nlearned from retail outlets in Dallas that Crescent Firearms, Inc.,\r\nof New York City, was a distributor of surplus Italian 6.5-millimeter\r\nmilitary rifles.[C4-2] During the evening of November 22, 1963, a\r\nreview of the records of Crescent Firearms revealed that the firm had\r\nshipped an Italian carbine, serial number C2766, to Klein\u2019s Sporting\r\nGoods Co., of Chicago, Ill.[C4-3] After searching their records from\r\n10 p.m. to 4 a.m. the officers of Klein\u2019s discovered that a rifle\r\nbearing serial number C2766 had been shipped to one A.

Hidell\r\nas additional persons entitled to receive mail in the box.[C4-32]\r\nThe New Orleans postal authorities had not discarded the portion of\r\nthe application listing the names of those, other than the owner of\r\nthe box, entitled to receive mail through the box. Expert testimony\r\nconfirmed that the writing on this application was that of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald.[C4-33]\r\n\r\nHidell\u2019s name on the post office box application was part of Oswald\u2019s\r\nuse of a nonexistent Hidell to serve as president of the so-called New\r\nOrleans Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. (As discussed\r\nbelow in ch. VI, p. 292.) Marina Oswald testified that she first\r\nlearned of Oswald\u2019s use of the fictitious name \u201cHidell\u201d in connection\r\nwith his pro-Castro activities in New Orleans.[C4-34] According\r\nto her testimony, he compelled her to write the name \u201cHidell\u201d on\r\nmembership cards in the space designated for the signature of the\r\n\u201cChapter President.\u201d[C4-35] The name \u201cHidell\u201d was stamped on some of\r\nthe \u201cChapter\u2019s\u201d printed literature and on the membership application\r\nblanks.[C4-36] Marina Oswald testified, \u201cI knew there was no such\r\norganization. And I know Hidell is merely an altered Fidel, and I\r\nlaughed at such foolishness.\u201d[C4-37] Hidell was a fictitious president\r\nof an organization of which Oswald was the only member.[C4-38]\r\n\r\nWhen seeking employment in New Orleans, Oswald listed a \u201cSgt. Robt.\r\nHidell\u201d as a reference on one job application[C4-39] and \u201cGeorge\r\nHidell\u201d as a reference on another.[C4-40] Both names were found to be\r\nfictitious.[C4-41] Moreover, the use of \u201cAlek\u201d as a first name for\r\nHidell is a further link to Oswald because \u201cAlek\u201d was Oswald\u2019s nickname\r\nin Russia.[C4-42] Letters received by Marina Oswald from her husband\r\nsigned \u201cAlek\u201d were given to the Commission.[C4-43]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s Palmprint on Rifle Barrel\r\n\r\nBased on the above evidence, the Commission concluded that Oswald\r\npurchased the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository\r\nBuilding. Additional evidence of ownership was provided in the form of\r\npalmprint identification which indicated that Oswald had possession of\r\nthe rifle he had purchased.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after the rifle was discovered on the sixth floor of\r\nthe Depository Building[C4-44] it was examined by Lt. J.\u00a0C. Day of\r\nthe identification bureau of the Dallas police. He lifted the rifle\r\nby the wooden stock after his examination convinced him that the wood\r\nwas too rough to take fingerprints. Capt. J.\u00a0W. Fritz then ejected a\r\ncartridge by operating the bolt, but only after Day viewed the knob\r\non the bolt through a magnifying glass and found no prints.[C4-45]\r\nDay continued to examine the rifle with the magnifying glass, looking\r\nfor possible fingerprints. He applied fingerprint powder to the side\r\nof the metal housing near the trigger, and noticed traces of two\r\nprints.[C4-46] At 11:45 p.m.", "start_char_idx": 330393, "end_char_idx": 334343, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "928b9959-a920-4698-8b23-2a24958e9a38": {"__data__": {"id_": "928b9959-a920-4698-8b23-2a24958e9a38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "657bebd5-7225-4309-8ffb-0a1ec18e57a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "d1b36a174ddcf3f6ef0092bbcb3bc42077360c6ad4fc2936ec0ab57c29dc3523", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c46ce45-e6b7-44b8-980e-ca0c0ebafeee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8e50ef424826f9f3070f56d0a9ff96a76bd14a6d4d581611fa0227a42f2caa9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A few minutes after the rifle was discovered on the sixth floor of\r\nthe Depository Building[C4-44] it was examined by Lt.

He applied fingerprint powder to the side\r\nof the metal housing near the trigger, and noticed traces of two\r\nprints.[C4-46] At 11:45 p.m. on November 22, the rifle was released\r\nto the FBI and forwarded to Washington where it was examined on the\r\nmorning of November 23 by Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the Latent\r\nFingerprint Section of the FBI\u2019s Identification Division.[C4-47]\r\n\r\nIn his testimony before the Commission, Latona stated that when he\r\nreceived the rifle, the area where prints were visible was protected by\r\ncellophane.[C4-48] He examined these prints, as well as photographs of\r\nthem which the Dallas police had made, and concluded that:\r\n\r\n    * * * the formations, the ridge formations and characteristics,\r\n    were insufficient for purposes of either effecting\r\n    identification or a determination that the print was not\r\n    identical with the prints of people. Accordingly, my opinion\r\n    simply was that the latent prints which were there were of no\r\n    value.[C4-49]\r\n\r\nLatona then processed the complete weapon but developed no identifiable\r\nprints.[C4-50] He stated that the poor quality of the wood and the\r\nmetal would cause the rifle to absorb moisture from the skin, thereby\r\nmaking a clear print unlikely.[C4-51]\r\n\r\nOn November 22, however, before surrendering possession of the rifle\r\nto the FBI Laboratory, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas Police Department\r\nhad \u201clifted\u201d a palmprint from the underside of the gun barrel \u201cnear\r\nthe firing end of the barrel about 3 inches under the Woodstock when I\r\ntook the Woodstock loose.\u201d[C4-52] \u201cLifting\u201d a print involves the use of\r\nadhesive material to remove the fingerprint powder which adheres to the\r\noriginal print. In this way the powdered impression is actually removed\r\nfrom the object.[C4-53] The lifting had been so complete in this case\r\nthat there was no trace of the print on the rifle itself when it was\r\nexamined by Latona. Nor was there any indication that the lift had been\r\nperformed.[C4-54] Day, on the other hand, believed that sufficient\r\ntraces of the print had been left on the rifle barrel, because he\r\ndid not release the lifted print until November 26, when he received\r\ninstructions to send \u201ceverything that we had\u201d to the FBI.[C4-55] The\r\nprint arrived in the FBI Laboratory in Washington on November 29,\r\nmounted on a card on which Lieutenant Day had written the words \u201coff\r\nunderside gun barrel near end of foregrip C2766.\u201d[C4-56] The print\u2019s\r\npositive identity as having been lifted from the rifle was confirmed\r\nby FBI Laboratory tests which established that the adhesive material\r\nbearing the print also bore impressions of the same irregularities that\r\nappeared on the barrel of the rifle.[C4-57]\r\n\r\nLatona testified that this palmprint was the right palmprint of\r\nLee Harvey Oswald.[C4-58] At the request of the Commission, Arthur\r\nMandella, fingerprint expert with the New York City Police Department,\r\nconducted an independent examination and also determined that this\r\nwas the right palmprint of Oswald.[C4-59] Latona\u2019s findings were also\r\nconfirmed by Ronald G. Wittmus, another FBI fingerprint expert.[C4-60]\r\nIn the opinion of these experts, it was not possible to estimate the\r\ntime which elapsed between the placing of the print on the rifle and\r\nthe date of the lift.[C4-61]\r\n\r\nExperts testifying before the Commission agreed that palmprints\r\nare as unique as fingerprints for purposes of establishing\r\nidentification.[C4-62] Oswald\u2019s palmprint on the underside of the\r\nbarrel demonstrates that he handled the rifle when it was disassembled.\r\nA palmprint could not be placed on this portion of the rifle, when\r\nassembled, because the wooden foregrip covers the barrel at this\r\npoint.[C4-63] The print is additional proof that the rifle was in\r\nOswald\u2019s possession.", "start_char_idx": 333625, "end_char_idx": 337994, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c46ce45-e6b7-44b8-980e-ca0c0ebafeee": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c46ce45-e6b7-44b8-980e-ca0c0ebafeee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "928b9959-a920-4698-8b23-2a24958e9a38", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "6da431d4e0855d6fed16a0ab0fb89f1e86292cba14ddce0bb753f4e739963151", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c6f3ec2e-52e5-48e7-be12-1b9df985d31a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c6394ccdde5e765c89c2e204e061833b92350ff758b40e730bbb64e764f40ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C4-59] Latona\u2019s findings were also\r\nconfirmed by Ronald G.

Stombaugh, a special agent assigned to the Hair\r\nand Fiber Unit of the FBI Laboratory.[C4-65] He compared them with the\r\nfibers found in the shirt which Oswald was wearing when arrested in\r\nthe Texas Theatre.[C4-66] This shirt was also composed of dark blue,\r\ngray-black and orange-yellow cotton fibers. Stombaugh testified that\r\nthe colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the\r\nrifle matched those in Oswald\u2019s shirt.[C4-67] (See app. X, p. 592.)\r\n\r\nStombaugh explained in his testimony that in fiber analysis, as\r\ndistinct from fingerprint or firearms identification, it is not\r\npossible to state with scientific certainty that a particular small\r\ngroup of fibers come from a certain piece of clothing to the exclusion\r\nof all others because there are not enough microscopic characteristics\r\npresent in fibers.[C4-68] Judgments as to probability will depend on\r\nthe number and types of matches.[C4-69] He concluded, \u201cThere is no\r\ndoubt in my mind that these fibers could have come from this shirt.\r\nThere is no way, however, to eliminate the possibility of the fibers\r\nhaving come from another identical shirt.\u201d[C4-70]\r\n\r\nHaving considered the probabilities as explained in Stombaugh\u2019s\r\ntestimony, the Commission has concluded that the fibers in the tuft\r\non the rifle most probably came from the shirt worn by Oswald when he\r\nwas arrested, and that this was the same shirt which Oswald wore on\r\nthe morning of the assassination. Marina Oswald testified that she\r\nthought her husband wore this shirt to work on that day.[C4-71] The\r\ntestimony of those who saw him after the assassination was inconclusive\r\nabout the color of Oswald\u2019s shirt,[C4-72] but Mary Bledsoe, a former\r\nlandlady of Oswald, saw him on a bus approximately 10 minutes after\r\nthe assassination and identified the shirt as being the one worn by\r\nOswald primarily because of a distinctive hole in the shirt\u2019s right\r\nelbow.[C4-73] Moreover, the bus transfer which he obtained as he left\r\nthe bus was still in the pocket when he was arrested.[C4-74] Although\r\nOswald returned to his roominghouse after the assassination and when\r\nquestioned by the police, claimed to have changed his shirt,[C4-75] the\r\nevidence indicates that he continued wearing the same shirt which he\r\nwas wearing all morning and which he was still wearing when arrested.\r\n\r\nIn light of these findings the Commission evaluated the additional\r\ntestimony of Stombaugh that the fibers were caught in the crevice of\r\nthe rifle\u2019s butt plate \u201cin the recent past.\u201d[C4-76] Although Stombaugh\r\nwas unable to estimate the period of time the fibers were on the rifle\r\nhe said that the fibers \u201cwere clean, they had good color to them,\r\nthere was no grease on them and they were not fragmented. They looked\r\nas if they had just been picked up.\u201d[C4-77] The relative freshness\r\nof the fibers is strong evidence that they were caught on the rifle\r\non the morning of the assassination or during the preceding evening.\r\nFor 10 days prior to the eve of the assassination Oswald had not been\r\npresent at Ruth Paine\u2019s house in Irving, Tex.,[C4-78] where the rifle\r\nwas kept.", "start_char_idx": 337227, "end_char_idx": 341358, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6f3ec2e-52e5-48e7-be12-1b9df985d31a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6f3ec2e-52e5-48e7-be12-1b9df985d31a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c46ce45-e6b7-44b8-980e-ca0c0ebafeee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "798a03722762735e8b58280660cc18a7a9ab3e437ae035adf998cdf475a6a889", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "120bdb65-8430-4556-803a-9fa8278d193a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bdbe9567d7407e5a9fac88f96574183cda8a59bbab83da27229a183257603b84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In light of these findings the Commission evaluated the additional\r\ntestimony of Stombaugh that the fibers were caught in the crevice of\r\nthe rifle\u2019s butt plate \u201cin the recent past.\u201d[C4-76] Although Stombaugh\r\nwas unable to estimate the period of time the fibers were on the rifle\r\nhe said that the fibers \u201cwere clean, they had good color to them,\r\nthere was no grease on them and they were not fragmented.

The\r\nCommission was able to conclude, however, that the fibers most probably\r\ncame from Oswald\u2019s shirt. This adds to the conviction of the Commission\r\nthat Oswald owned and handled the weapon used in the assassination.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotograph of Oswald With Rifle\r\n\r\nDuring the period from March 2, 1963, to April 24, 1963, the Oswalds\r\nlived on Neely Street in Dallas in a rented house which had a small\r\nback yard.[C4-82] One Sunday, while his wife was hanging diapers,\r\nOswald asked her to take a picture of him holding a rifle, a pistol\r\nand issues of two newspapers later identified as the Worker and the\r\nMilitant.[C4-83] Two pictures were taken. The Commission has concluded\r\nthat the rifle shown in these pictures is the same rifle which was\r\nfound on the sixth floor of the Depository Building on November 22,\r\n1963.

Shaneyfelt, a photography\r\nexpert with the FBI, photographed the rifle used in the assassination,\r\nattempting to duplicate the position of the rifle and the lighting in\r\nExhibit No. 133-A.[C4-85] After comparing the rifle in the simulated\r\nphotograph with the rifle in Exhibit No. 133-A, Shaneyfelt testified,\r\n\u201cI found it to be the same general configuration. All appearances were\r\nthe same.\u201d He found \u201cone notch in the stock at this point that appears\r\nvery faintly in the photograph.\u201d He stated, however, that while he\r\n\u201cfound no differences\u201d between the rifles in the two photographs, he\r\ncould not make a \u201cpositive identification to the exclusion of all other\r\nrifles of the same general configuration.\u201d[C4-86]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPHS OF OSWALD HOLDING RIFLE\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 133-A\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 133-B\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 134\r\n\r\n(Enlargement of Commission Exhibit No. 133-A)]\r\n\r\nThe authenticity of these pictures has been established by expert\r\ntestimony which links the second picture, Commission Exhibit No. 133-B,\r\nto Oswald\u2019s Imperial Reflex camera, with which Marina Oswald testified\r\nshe took the pictures.[C4-87] The negative of that picture, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 133-B, was found among Oswald\u2019s possessions.", "start_char_idx": 340580, "end_char_idx": 344660, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "120bdb65-8430-4556-803a-9fa8278d193a": {"__data__": {"id_": "120bdb65-8430-4556-803a-9fa8278d193a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6f3ec2e-52e5-48e7-be12-1b9df985d31a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "dfd3d78d268998efd93edc013a9557b2124eba8858e2e44afb2442a05e7e87ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb3df6a7-e5d6-4662-b2d1-2428a5899cd8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2a55cf0472a1e65a127074af6aa84e8c9633dddfba1673f819258ed71e69e80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "133-A\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 133-B\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 134\r\n\r\n(Enlargement of Commission Exhibit No. 133-A)]\r\n\r\nThe authenticity of these pictures has been established by expert\r\ntestimony which links the second picture, Commission Exhibit No. 133-B,\r\nto Oswald\u2019s Imperial Reflex camera, with which Marina Oswald testified\r\nshe took the pictures.[C4-87] The negative of that picture, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 133-B, was found among Oswald\u2019s possessions.[C4-88]\r\nUsing a recognized technique of determining whether a picture was\r\ntaken with a particular camera, Shaneyfelt compared this negative\r\nwith a negative which he made by taking a new picture with Oswald\u2019s\r\ncamera.[C4-89] He concluded that the negative of Exhibit No. 133-B was\r\nexposed in Oswald\u2019s Imperial Reflex camera to the exclusion of all\r\nother cameras.[C4-90] He could not test Exhibit No. 133-A in the same\r\nway because the negative was never recovered.[C4-91] Both pictures,\r\nhowever, have identical backgrounds and lighting and, judging from the\r\nshadows, were taken at the same angle. They are photographs of the\r\nsame scene.[C4-92] Since Exhibit No. 133-B was taken with Oswald\u2019s\r\ncamera, it is reasonably certain that Exhibit No. 133-A was taken by\r\nthe same camera at the same time, as Marina Oswald testified. Moreover,\r\nShaneyfelt testified that in his opinion the photographs were not\r\ncomposites of two different photographs and that Oswald\u2019s face had not\r\nbeen superimposed on another body.[C4-93]\r\n\r\nOne of the photographs taken by Marina Oswald was widely published\r\nin newspapers and magazines, and in many instances the details of\r\nthese pictures differed from the original, and even from each other,\r\nparticularly as to the configuration of the rifle. The Commission\r\nsought to determine whether these photographs were retouched prior\r\nto publication. Shaneyfelt testified that the published photographs\r\nappeared to be based on a copy of the original which the publications\r\nhad each retouched differently.[C4-94] Several of the publications\r\nfurnished the Commission with the prints they had used, or described by\r\ncorrespondence the retouching they had done. This information enabled\r\nthe Commission to conclude that the published pictures were the same\r\nas the original except for retouching done by these publications,\r\napparently for the purpose of clarifying the lines of the rifle and\r\nother details in the picture.[C4-95]\r\n\r\nThe dates surrounding the taking of this picture and the purchase of\r\nthe rifle reinforce the belief that the rifle in the photograph is\r\nthe rifle which Oswald bought from Klein\u2019s. The rifle was shipped\r\nfrom Klein\u2019s in Chicago on March 20, 1963, at a time when the Oswalds\r\nwere living on Neely Street.[C4-96] From an examination of one of\r\nthe photographs, the Commission determined the dates of the issues\r\nof the Militant and the Worker which Oswald was holding in his hand.\r\nBy checking the actual mailing dates of these issues and the time it\r\nusually takes to effect delivery to Dallas, it was established that the\r\nphotographs must have been taken sometime after March 27.[C4-97] Marina\r\nOswald testified that the photographs were taken on a Sunday about 2\r\nweeks before the attempted shooting of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker on\r\nApril 10, 1963.[C4-98] By Sunday, March 31, 1963, 10 days prior to the\r\nWalker attempt, Oswald had undoubtedly received the rifle shipped from\r\nChicago on March 20, the revolver shipped from Los Angeles on the same\r\ndate,[C4-99] and the two newspapers which he was holding in the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nRifle Among Oswald\u2019s Possessions\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald testified that the rifle found on the sixth floor of the\r\nDepository Building was the \u201cfateful rifle of Lee Oswald.\u201d[C4-100]\r\nMoreover, it was the only rifle owned by her husband following his\r\nreturn from the Soviet Union in June 1962.[C4-101] It had been\r\npurchased in March 1963, and taken to New Orleans where Marina Oswald\r\nsaw it in their rented apartment during the summer of 1963.[C4-102]\r\nIt appears from his wife\u2019s testimony that Oswald may have sat on the\r\nscreened-in porch at night practicing with the rifle by looking through\r\nthe telescopic sight and operating the bolt.", "start_char_idx": 344199, "end_char_idx": 348390, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb3df6a7-e5d6-4662-b2d1-2428a5899cd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb3df6a7-e5d6-4662-b2d1-2428a5899cd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "120bdb65-8430-4556-803a-9fa8278d193a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "2b973bfe7b4d6eba5466a9026d7f3c010b7a28a88cc080abc714f4d557053842", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33fd3bcb-8342-406e-b8ce-7bc5ea86a399", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0d84dcae8fb2bbc1109aa040c8fd9cb4e3db3f6614cbf87ff4d13cec8432f9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rifle Among Oswald\u2019s Possessions\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald testified that the rifle found on the sixth floor of the\r\nDepository Building was the \u201cfateful rifle of Lee Oswald.\u201d[C4-100]\r\nMoreover, it was the only rifle owned by her husband following his\r\nreturn from the Soviet Union in June 1962.[C4-101] It had been\r\npurchased in March 1963, and taken to New Orleans where Marina Oswald\r\nsaw it in their rented apartment during the summer of 1963.[C4-102]\r\nIt appears from his wife\u2019s testimony that Oswald may have sat on the\r\nscreened-in porch at night practicing with the rifle by looking through\r\nthe telescopic sight and operating the bolt.[C4-103] In September 1963,\r\nOswald loaded their possessions into a station wagon owned by Ruth\r\nPaine, who had invited Marina Oswald and the baby to live at her home\r\nin Irving,[C4-104] Tex. Marina Oswald has stated that the rifle was\r\namong these possessions,[C4-105] although Ruth Paine testified that she\r\nwas not aware of it.[C4-106]\r\n\r\nFrom September 24, 1963, when Marina Oswald arrived in Irving from\r\nNew Orleans, until the morning of the assassination, the rifle was,\r\naccording to the evidence, stored in a green and brown blanket in the\r\nPaines\u2019 garage among the Oswalds\u2019 other possessions.[C4-107] About 1\r\nweek after the return from New Orleans, Marina Oswald was looking in\r\nthe garage for parts to the baby\u2019s crib and thought that the parts\r\nmight be in the blanket. When she started to open the blanket, she saw\r\nthe stock of the rifle.[C4-108] Ruth and Michael Paine both noticed the\r\nrolled-up blanket in the garage during the time that Marina Oswald was\r\nliving in their home.[C4-109] On several occasions, Michael Paine moved\r\nthe blanket in the garage.[C4-110] He thought it contained tent poles,\r\nor possibly other camping equipment such as a folding shovel.[C4-111]\r\nWhen he appeared before the Commission, Michael Paine lifted the\r\nblanket with the rifle wrapped inside and testified that it appeared\r\nto be the same approximate weight and shape as the package in his\r\ngarage.[C4-112]\r\n\r\nAbout 3 hours after the assassination, a detective and deputy sheriff\r\nsaw the blanket-roll, tied with a string, lying on the floor of the\r\nPaines\u2019 garage. Each man testified that he thought he could detect\r\nthe outline of a rifle in the blanket, even though the blanket was\r\nempty.[C4-113] Paul M. Stombaugh, of the FBI Laboratory, examined the\r\nblanket and discovered a bulge approximately 10 inches long midway\r\nin the blanket. This bulge was apparently caused by a hard protruding\r\nobject which had stretched the blanket\u2019s fibers. It could have been\r\ncaused by the telescopic sight of the rifle which was approximately 11\r\ninches long.[C4-114] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, p. 132.)\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nHaving reviewed the evidence that (1) Lee Harvey Oswald purchased the\r\nrifle used in the assassination, (2) Oswald\u2019s palmprint was on the\r\nrifle in a position which shows that he had handled it while it was\r\ndisassembled, (3) fibers found on the rifle most probably came from\r\nthe shirt Oswald was wearing on the day of the assassination, (4) a\r\nphotograph taken in the yard of Oswald\u2019s apartment showed him holding\r\nthis rifle, and (5) the rifle was kept among Oswald\u2019s possessions\r\nfrom the time of its purchase until the day of the assassination, the\r\nCommission concluded that the rifle used to assassinate President\r\nKennedy and wound Governor Connally was owned and possessed by Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIFLE IN THE BUILDING\r\n\r\nThe Commission has evaluated the evidence tending to show how Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald\u2019s Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, serial number C2766, was\r\nbrought into the Depository Building, where it was found on the\r\nsixth floor shortly after the assassination.

Oswald\r\ntraveled between Dallas and Irving on weekends in a car driven by a\r\nneighbor of the Paines, Buell Wesley Frazier, who also worked at the\r\nDepository.[C4-116] Oswald generally would go to Irving on Friday\r\nafternoon and return to Dallas Monday morning. According to the\r\ntestimony of Frazier, Marina Oswald, and Ruth Paine, it appears that\r\nOswald never returned to Irving in midweek prior to November 21, 1963,\r\nexcept on Monday, October 21, when he visited his wife in the hospital\r\nafter the birth of their second child.[C4-117]\r\n\r\nDuring the morning of November 21, Oswald asked Frazier whether he\r\ncould ride home with him that afternoon. Frazier, surprised, asked\r\nhim why he was going to Irving on Thursday night rather than Friday.\r\nOswald replied, \u201cI\u2019m going home to get some curtain rods * * * [to]\r\nput in an apartment.\u201d[C4-118] The two men left work at 4:40 p.m. and\r\ndrove to Irving. There was little conversation between them on the way\r\nhome.[C4-119] Mrs. Linnie Mae Randle, Frazier\u2019s sister, commented to\r\nher brother about Oswald\u2019s unusual midweek return to Irving. Frazier\r\ntold her that Oswald had come home to get curtain rods.[C4-120]\r\n\r\nIt would appear, however, that obtaining curtain rods was not the\r\npurpose of Oswald\u2019s trip to Irving on November 21.

Johnson,\r\nhis landlady, testified that Oswald\u2019s room at 1026 North Beckley Avenue\r\nhad curtains and curtain rods,[C4-121] and that Oswald had never\r\ndiscussed the subject with her.[C4-122] In the Paines\u2019 garage, along\r\nwith many other objects of a household character, there were two flat\r\nlightweight curtain rods belonging to Ruth Paine but they were still\r\nthere on Friday afternoon after Oswald\u2019s arrest.[C4-123] Oswald never\r\nasked Mrs. Paine about the use of curtain rods,[C4-124] and Marina\r\nOswald testified that Oswald did not say anything about curtain rods\r\non the day before the assassination.[C4-125] No curtain rods were\r\nknown to have been discovered in the Depository Building after the\r\nassassination.[C4-126] In deciding whether Oswald carried a rifle to\r\nwork in a long paper bag on November 22, the Commission gave weight to\r\nthe fact that Oswald gave a false reason for returning home on November\r\n21, and one which provided an excuse for the carrying of a bulky\r\npackage the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Missing Rifle\r\n\r\nBefore dinner on November 21, Oswald played on the lawn of the Paines\u2019\r\nhome with his daughter June.[C4-127] After dinner Ruth Paine and\r\nMarina Oswald were busy cleaning house and preparing their children\r\nfor bed.[C4-128] Between the hours of 8 and 9 p.m. they were occupied\r\nwith the children in the bedrooms located at the extreme east end of\r\nthe house.[C4-129] On the west end of the house is the attached garage,\r\nwhich can be reached from the kitchen or from the outside.[C4-130] In\r\nthe garage were the personal belongings of the Oswald family including,\r\nas the evidence has shown, the rifle wrapped in the old brown and green\r\nblanket.", "start_char_idx": 351223, "end_char_idx": 355309, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3416600-c8fd-4625-950c-c9ed270b8060": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3416600-c8fd-4625-950c-c9ed270b8060", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "33fd3bcb-8342-406e-b8ce-7bc5ea86a399", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "9a22f73a2d0dd669b0acf1bfaa1a955f313c0eb7bfc7ea8682b031300086cbaa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "76aed60b-ae2b-4d8c-ba01-2915e1579cd7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ca7c0b0dd2e0a0cc197464ba875d6ad87d8fce480f37b0099a599e7aa5259a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Missing Rifle\r\n\r\nBefore dinner on November 21, Oswald played on the lawn of the Paines\u2019\r\nhome with his daughter June.[C4-127] After dinner Ruth Paine and\r\nMarina Oswald were busy cleaning house and preparing their children\r\nfor bed.[C4-128] Between the hours of 8 and 9 p.m. they were occupied\r\nwith the children in the bedrooms located at the extreme east end of\r\nthe house.[C4-129] On the west end of the house is the attached garage,\r\nwhich can be reached from the kitchen or from the outside.[C4-130] In\r\nthe garage were the personal belongings of the Oswald family including,\r\nas the evidence has shown, the rifle wrapped in the old brown and green\r\nblanket.[C4-131]\r\n\r\nAt approximately 9 p.m., after the children had been put to bed, Mrs.\r\nPaine, according to her testimony before the Commission, \u201cwent out to\r\nthe garage to paint some children\u2019s blocks, and worked in the garage\r\nfor half an hour or so. I noticed when I went out that the light was\r\non.\u201d[C4-132] Mrs. Paine was certain that she had not left the light on\r\nin the garage after dinner.[C4-133] According to Mrs. Paine, Oswald\r\nhad gone to bed by 9 p.m.;[C4-134] Marina Oswald testified that it was\r\nbetween 9 and 10 p.m.[C4-135] Neither Marina Oswald nor Ruth Paine\r\nsaw Oswald in the garage.[C4-136] The period between 8 and 9 p.m.,\r\nhowever, provided ample opportunity for Oswald to prepare the rifle for\r\nhis departure the next morning. Only if disassembled could the rifle\r\nfit into the paper bag found near the window[C4-137] from which the\r\nshots were fired. A firearms expert with the FBI assembled the rifle\r\nin 6 minutes using a 10-cent coin as a tool, and he could disassemble\r\nit more rapidly.[C4-138] While the rifle may have already been\r\ndisassembled when Oswald arrived home on Thursday, he had ample time\r\nthat evening to disassemble the rifle and insert it into the paper bag.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the assassination, Marina Oswald was watching television\r\nwhen she learned of the shooting. A short time later Mrs. Paine told\r\nher that someone had shot the President \u201cfrom the building in which\r\nLee is working.\u201d Marina Oswald testified that at that time \u201cMy heart\r\ndropped. I then went to the garage to see whether the rifle was there\r\nand I saw that the blanket was still there and I said \u2018Thank God.\u2019\u201d She\r\ndid not unroll the blanket. She saw that it was in its usual position\r\nand it appeared to her to have something inside.[C4-139]\r\n\r\nSoon afterward, at about 3 p.m., police officers arrived and searched\r\nthe house. Mrs. Paine pointed out that most of the Oswalds\u2019 possessions\r\nwere in the garage.[C4-140] With Ruth Paine acting as an interpreter,\r\nDetective Rose asked Marina whether her husband had a rifle. Mrs.\r\nPaine, who had no knowledge of the rifle, first said \u201cNo,\u201d but when\r\nthe question was translated, Marina Oswald replied \u201cYes.\u201d[C4-141] She\r\npointed to the blanket which was on the floor very close to where Ruth\r\nPaine was standing. Mrs. Paine testified:\r\n\r\n    As she [Marina] told me about it I stepped onto the blanket\r\n    roll. * * * And she indicated to me that she had peered into\r\n    this roll and saw a portion of what she took to be a gun she\r\n    knew her husband to have, a rifle.

Mrs. Randle stated that on\r\nthe morning of November 22, while her brother was eating breakfast, she\r\nlooked out the breakfast-room window and saw Oswald cross the street\r\nand walk toward the driveway where her brother parked his car near\r\nthe carport. He carried a \u201cheavy brown bag.\u201d[C4-147] Oswald gripped\r\nthe bag in his right hand near the top. \u201cIt tapered like this as he\r\nhugged it in his hand.

He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s\r\nthe package, Lee?\u201d Oswald replied, \u201ccurtain rods.\u201d[C4-153] Frazier told\r\nthe Commission \u201c* * * the main reason he was going over there that\r\nThursday afternoon when he was to bring back some curtain rods, so I\r\ndidn\u2019t think any more about it when he told me that.\u201d[C4-154] Frazier\r\nestimated that the bag was 2 feet long \u201cgive and take a few inches,\u201d\r\nand about 5 or 6 inches wide.[C4-155] As they sat in the car, Frazier\r\nasked Oswald where his lunch was, and Oswald replied that he was going\r\nto buy his lunch that day.[C4-156] Frazier testified that Oswald\r\ncarried no lunch bag that day. \u201cWhen he rode with me, I say he always\r\nbrought lunch except that one day on November 22 he didn\u2019t bring his\r\nlunch that day.\u201d[C4-157]\r\n\r\nFrazier parked the car in the company parking lot about 2 blocks\r\nnorth of the Depository Building. Oswald left the car first, picked\r\nup the brown paper bag, and proceeded toward the building ahead of\r\nFrazier. Frazier walked behind and as they crossed the railroad tracks\r\nhe watched the switching of the cars. Frazier recalled that one end\r\nof the package was under Oswald\u2019s armpit and the lower part was held\r\nwith his right hand so that it was carried straight and parallel\r\nto his body. When Oswald entered the rear door of the Depository\r\nBuilding, he was about 50 feet ahead of Frazier. It was the first time\r\nthat Oswald had not walked with Frazier from the parking lot to the\r\nbuilding entrance.[C4-158] When Frazier entered the building, he did\r\nnot see Oswald.[C4-159] One employee, Jack Dougherty, believed that he\r\nsaw Oswald coming to work, but he does not remember that Oswald had\r\nanything in his hands as he entered the door.", "start_char_idx": 357845, "end_char_idx": 361686, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "169a8514-95e7-482c-80e4-4bfcd4c8ef94": {"__data__": {"id_": "169a8514-95e7-482c-80e4-4bfcd4c8ef94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "76aed60b-ae2b-4d8c-ba01-2915e1579cd7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "c2fc701921e645a8c534cec589af90a9cadb8a6c517c48186f6d40907112011f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "363c2fef-1ae2-48a3-aa7d-2eba707a8532", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5fd19834a19eebe4ec4a5298fa24d7744efe0c246df40582bffd8c1d05b0ce9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Frazier walked behind and as they crossed the railroad tracks\r\nhe watched the switching of the cars.

Frazier and Mrs. Randle testified that the bag which\r\nOswald was carrying was approximately 27 or 28 inches long,[C4-162]\r\nwhereas the wooden stock of the rifle, which is its largest component,\r\nmeasured 34.8 inches.[C4-163] The bag found on the sixth floor was 38\r\ninches long.[C4-164] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, p. 132.) When\r\nFrazier appeared before the Commission and was asked to demonstrate\r\nhow Oswald carried the package, he said, \u201cLike I said, I remember\r\nthat I didn\u2019t look at the package very much * * * but when I did\r\nlook at it he did have his hands on the package like that,\u201d[C4-165]\r\nand at this point Frazier placed the upper part of the package under\r\nhis armpit and attempted to cup his right hand beneath the bottom of\r\nthe bag. The disassembled rifle was too long to be carried in this\r\nmanner. Similarly, when the butt of the rifle was placed in Frazier\u2019s\r\nhand, it extended above his shoulder to ear level.[C4-166] Moreover,\r\nin an interview on December 1, 1963, with agents of the FBI, Frazier\r\nhad marked the point on the back seat of his car which he believed\r\nwas where the bag reached when it was laid on the seat with one edge\r\nagainst the door. The distance between the point on the seat and the\r\ndoor was 27 inches.[C4-167]\r\n\r\nMrs. Randle said, when shown the paper bag, that the bag she saw Oswald\r\ncarrying \u201cwasn\u2019t that long, I mean it was folded down at the top as\r\nI told you. It definitely wasn\u2019t that long.\u201d[C4-168] And she folded\r\nthe bag to a length of about 28\u00bd inches. Frazier doubted whether the\r\nbag that Oswald carried was as wide as the bag found on the sixth\r\nfloor,[C4-169] although Mrs. Randle testified that the width was\r\napproximately the same.[C4-170]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has weighed the visual recollection of Frazier and\r\nMrs. Randle against the evidence here presented that the bag Oswald\r\ncarried contained the assassination weapon and has concluded that\r\nFrazier and Randle are mistaken as to the length of the bag. Mrs.\r\nRandle saw the bag fleetingly and her first remembrance is that it was\r\nheld in Oswald\u2019s right hand \u201cand it almost touched the ground as he\r\ncarried it.\u201d[C4-171] Frazier\u2019s view of the bag was from the rear. He\r\ncontinually advised that he was not paying close attention.[C4-172] For\r\nexample, he said,\r\n\r\n    * * * I didn\u2019t pay too much attention the way he was walking\r\n    because I was walking along there looking at the railroad cars\r\n    and watching the men on the diesel switch them cars and I\r\n    didn\u2019t pay too much attention on how he carried the package at\r\n    all.[C4-173]\r\n\r\nFrazier could easily have been mistaken when he stated that Oswald held\r\nthe bottom of the bag cupped in his hand with the upper end tucked into\r\nhis armpit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation of Bag\r\n\r\nA handmade bag of wrapping paper and tape[C4-174] was found in the\r\nsoutheast corner of the sixth floor alongside the window from which the\r\nshots were fired.[C4-175] (See Commission Exhibit No. 2707, p. 142.)", "start_char_idx": 360955, "end_char_idx": 364964, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "363c2fef-1ae2-48a3-aa7d-2eba707a8532": {"__data__": {"id_": "363c2fef-1ae2-48a3-aa7d-2eba707a8532", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "169a8514-95e7-482c-80e4-4bfcd4c8ef94", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "0393d529a393cbe6a8a54c67aa23a9b9d7199b494dd3d565dbcdeae3d35562a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "41d429cb-2c9c-40ee-bc4f-99404f2055e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "60b9a70ce3e5683a8c0d52b16accfc168542258771606619f4a4ae2b4ded9b21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He\r\ncontinually advised that he was not paying close attention.[C4-172] For\r\nexample, he said,\r\n\r\n    * * * I didn\u2019t pay too much attention the way he was walking\r\n    because I was walking along there looking at the railroad cars\r\n    and watching the men on the diesel switch them cars and I\r\n    didn\u2019t pay too much attention on how he carried the package at\r\n    all.[C4-173]\r\n\r\nFrazier could easily have been mistaken when he stated that Oswald held\r\nthe bottom of the bag cupped in his hand with the upper end tucked into\r\nhis armpit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation of Bag\r\n\r\nA handmade bag of wrapping paper and tape[C4-174] was found in the\r\nsoutheast corner of the sixth floor alongside the window from which the\r\nshots were fired.[C4-175] (See Commission Exhibit No. 2707, p. 142.) It\r\nwas not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a store and it\r\nwas presumably made for a particular purpose. It was the appropriate\r\nsize to contain, in disassembled form, Oswald\u2019s Mannlicher-Carcano\r\nrifle, serial No. C2766, which was also found on the sixth\r\nfloor.[C4-176] Three cartons had been placed at the window apparently\r\nto act as a gun rest and a fourth carton was placed behind those at the\r\nwindow.[C4-177] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1301, p. 138.) A person\r\nseated on the fourth carton could assemble the rifle without being seen\r\nfrom the rest of the sixth floor because the cartons stacked around the\r\nsoutheast corner would shield him.[C4-178] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n723, p. 80.) The presence of the bag in this corner is cogent evidence\r\nthat it was used as the container for the rifle. At the time the bag\r\nwas found, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas police wrote on it, \u201cFound next\r\nto the sixth floor window gun fired from. May have been used to carry\r\ngun. Lt. J.\u00a0C.

Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the FBI\u2019s\r\nLatent Fingerprint Section, identified these prints as the left index\r\nfingerprint and right palmprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-181] The\r\nportion of the palm which was identified was the heel of the right\r\npalm, i.e., the area near the wrist, on the little finger side.[C4-182]\r\nThese prints were examined independently by Ronald G. Wittmus of the\r\nFBI,[C4-183] and by Arthur Mandella, a fingerprint expert with the New\r\nYork City Police Department.[C4-184] Both concluded that the prints\r\nwere the right palm and left index finger of Lee Oswald. No other\r\nidentifiable prints were found on the bag.[C4-185]\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s palmprint on the bottom of the paper bag indicated, of course,\r\nthat he had handled the bag. Furthermore, it was consistent with the\r\nbag having contained a heavy or bulky object when he handled it since a\r\nlight object is usually held by the fingers.[C4-186] The palmprint was\r\nfound on the closed end of the bag. It was from Oswald\u2019s right hand, in\r\nwhich he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier\u2019s car to\r\nthe building.[C4-187]\r\n\r\n_Materials used to make bag._--On the day of the assassination, the\r\nDallas police obtained a sample of wrapping paper and tape from the\r\nshipping room of the Depository and forwarded it to the FBI Laboratory\r\nin Washington.[C4-188] James C.

This was done as an investigatory aid\r\nsince the original bag had been discolored during various laboratory\r\nexaminations and could not be used for valid identification by\r\nwitnesses.[C4-193] Cadigan found that the paper used to make this\r\nreplica sack had different characteristics from the paper in the\r\noriginal bag.[C4-194] The science of paper analysis enabled him to\r\ndistinguish between different rolls of paper even though they were\r\nproduced by the same manufacturer.[C4-195]\r\n\r\nSince the Depository normally used approximately one roll of paper\r\nevery 3 working days,[C4-196] it was not surprising that the replica\r\nsack made on December 1, 1963, had different characteristics from\r\nboth the actual bag and the sample taken on November 22.

The freshness of prints developed in this manner[C4-228]\r\ncannot be estimated, so no conclusions can be drawn as to whether these\r\nremaining prints preceded or followed the print developed in Dallas\r\nby powder. Most of the prints were found to have been placed on the\r\ncartons by an FBI clerk and a Dallas police officer after the cartons\r\nhad been processed with powder by the Dallas Police.[C4-229] (See ch.\r\nVI, p. 249; app. X, p. 566.)\r\n\r\nIn his independent investigation, Arthur Mandella of the New York\r\nCity Police Department reached the same conclusion as Latona that the\r\nprints found on the cartons were those of Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-229]\r\nIn addition, Mandella was of the opinion that the print taken from the\r\ncarton on the floor was probably made within a day or a day and a half\r\nof the examination on November 22.[C4-230] Moreover, another expert\r\nwith the FBI, Ronald G. Wittmus, conducted a separate examination and\r\nalso agreed with Latona that the prints were Oswald\u2019s.[C4-231]\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the significance of these fingerprint and palmprint\r\nidentifications, the Commission considered the possibility that Oswald\r\nhandled these cartons as part of his normal duties. Since other\r\nidentifiable prints were developed on the cartons, the Commission\r\nrequested that they be compared with the prints of the 12 warehouse\r\nemployees who, like Oswald, might have handled the cartons. They were\r\nalso compared with the prints of those law enforcement officials who\r\nmight have handled the cartons. The results of this investigation are\r\nfully discussed in chapter VI, page 249. Although a person could handle\r\na carton and not leave identifiable prints, none of these employees\r\nexcept Oswald left identifiable prints on the cartons.[C4-232] This\r\nfinding, in addition to the freshness of one of the prints and the\r\npresence of Oswald\u2019s prints on two of the four cartons and the\r\npaper bag led the Commission to attach some probative value to the\r\nfingerprint and palmprint identifications in reaching the conclusion\r\nthat Oswald was at the window from which the shots were fired, although\r\nthe prints do not establish the exact time he was there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2707\r\n\r\nSIXTH FLOOR, TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY DALLAS, TEXAS]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s Presence on Sixth Floor Approximately 35 Minutes Before the\r\nAssassination\r\n\r\nAdditional testimony linking Oswald with the point from which the\r\nshots were fired was provided by the testimony of Charles Givens, who\r\nwas the last known employee to see Oswald inside the building prior\r\nto the assassination.

Givens thought this was about 11:55\r\na.m.[C4-240] None of the Depository employees is known to have seen\r\nOswald again until after the shooting.[C4-241]\r\n\r\nThe significance of Givens\u2019 observation that Oswald was carrying his\r\nclipboard became apparent on December 2, 1963, when an employee,\r\nFrankie Kaiser, found a clipboard hidden by book cartons in the\r\nnorthwest corner of the sixth floor at the west wall a few feet from\r\nwhere the rifle had been found.[C4-242] This clipboard had been made\r\nby Kaiser and had his name on it.[C4-243] Kaiser identified it as the\r\nclipboard which Oswald had appropriated from him when Oswald came to\r\nwork at the Depository.[C4-244] Three invoices on this clipboard,\r\neach dated November 22, were for Scott-Foresman books, located on the\r\nfirst and sixth floors.[C4-245] Oswald had not filled any of the three\r\norders.[C4-246]\r\n\r\n\r\nEyewitness Identification of Assassin\r\n\r\nHoward L. Brennan was an eyewitness to the shooting. As indicated\r\npreviously the Commission considered his testimony as probative in\r\nreaching the conclusion that the shots came from the sixth floor,\r\nsoutheast corner window of the Depository Building.[C4-247] (See ch.\r\nIII, pp. 61-68.) Brennan also testified that Lee Harvey Oswald, whom\r\nhe viewed in a police lineup on the night of the assassination, was\r\nthe man he saw fire the shots from the sixth-floor window of the\r\nDepository Building.[C4-248] When the shots were fired, Brennan was in\r\nan excellent position to observe anyone in the window. He was sitting\r\non a concrete wall on the southwest corner of Elm and Houston Streets,\r\nlooking north at the Depository Building which was directly in front of\r\nhim.[C4-249] The window was approximately 120 feet away.[C4-250](See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 477, p. 62.)\r\n\r\nIn the 6- to 8-minute period before the motorcade arrived,[C4-251]\r\nBrennan saw a man leave and return to the window \u201ca couple of\r\ntimes.\u201d[C4-252] After hearing the first shot, which he thought was a\r\nmotorcycle backfire, Brennan glanced up at the window. He testified\r\nthat \u201cthis man I saw previously was aiming for his last shot * * *\r\nas it appeared to me he was standing up and resting against the left\r\nwindow sill * * *.\u201d[C4-253]\r\n\r\nBrennan saw the man fire the last shot and disappear from the window.\r\nWithin minutes of the assassination, Brennan described the man to the\r\npolice.[C4-254] This description most probably led to the radio alert\r\nsent to police cars at approximately 12:45 p.m., which described the\r\nsuspect as white, slender, weighing about 165 pounds, about 5\u201910\u201d tall,\r\nand in his early thirties.[C4-255] In his sworn statement to the police\r\nlater that day, Brennan described the man in similar terms, except\r\nthat he gave the weight as between 165 and 175 pounds and the height\r\nwas omitted.", "start_char_idx": 381289, "end_char_idx": 385135, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24c4de03-6168-4eb4-916b-54c8ab61165b": {"__data__": {"id_": "24c4de03-6168-4eb4-916b-54c8ab61165b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a83828f-1822-4dd4-b082-808dd7deca6f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "a0bbe3f2da93993904cecf5346a0665f8e98d35c10e6d66c59694d4b1effb487", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b4665f0d-1aac-477b-8e5f-5f2fb4a19bcd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b82308c7c9d8d0947d7437597f42953f45789c8b3dab1b6d9923af58c2542b46", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He testified\r\nthat \u201cthis man I saw previously was aiming for his last shot * * *\r\nas it appeared to me he was standing up and resting against the left\r\nwindow sill * * *.\u201d[C4-253]\r\n\r\nBrennan saw the man fire the last shot and disappear from the window.\r\nWithin minutes of the assassination, Brennan described the man to the\r\npolice.[C4-254] This description most probably led to the radio alert\r\nsent to police cars at approximately 12:45 p.m., which described the\r\nsuspect as white, slender, weighing about 165 pounds, about 5\u201910\u201d tall,\r\nand in his early thirties.[C4-255] In his sworn statement to the police\r\nlater that day, Brennan described the man in similar terms, except\r\nthat he gave the weight as between 165 and 175 pounds and the height\r\nwas omitted.[C4-256] In his testimony before the Commission, Brennan\r\ndescribed the person he saw as \u201c* * * a man in his early thirties,\r\nfair complexion, slender, but neat, neat slender, possible 5 foot 10 *\r\n* * 160 to 170 pounds.\u201d[C4-257] Oswald was 5\u20199\u201d, slender and 24 years\r\nold. When arrested, he gave his weight as 140 pounds.[C4-258] On other\r\noccasions he gave weights of both 140 and 150 pounds.[C4-259] The New\r\nOrleans police records of his arrest in August of 1963 show a weight of\r\n136 pounds.[C4-260] The autopsy report indicated an estimated weight of\r\n150 pounds.[C4-261]\r\n\r\nBrennan\u2019s description should also be compared with the eyewitness\r\ndescription broadcast over the Dallas police radio at 1:22 p.m. of the\r\nman who shot Patrolman J.\u00a0D. Tippit. The suspect was described as \u201ca\r\nwhite male about 30, 5\u20198\u201d, black hair, slender. * * *\u201d[C4-262] At 1:29\r\np.m. the police radio reported that the description of the suspect in\r\nthe Tippit shooting was similar to the description which had been given\r\nby Brennan in connection with the assassination.[C4-263] Approximately\r\n7 or 8 minutes later the police radio reported that \u201can eyeball\r\nwitness\u201d described the suspect in the Tippit shooting as \u201ca white male,\r\n27, 5\u201911\u201d, 165 pounds, black wavy hair.\u201d[C4-264] As will be discussed\r\nfully below, the Commission has concluded that this suspect was Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nAlthough Brennan testified that the man in the window was standing\r\nwhen he fired the shots,[C4-265] most probably he was either sitting\r\nor kneeling. The half-open window,[C4-266] the arrangement of the\r\nboxes,[C4-267] and the angle of the shots virtually preclude a standing\r\nposition.[C4-268] It is understandable, however, for Brennan to have\r\nbelieved that the man with the rifle was standing. A photograph\r\nof the building taken seconds after the assassination shows three\r\nemployees looking out of the fifth-floor window directly below the\r\nwindow from which the shots were fired. Brennan testified that\r\nthey were standing,[C4-269] which is their apparent position in the\r\nphotograph.[C4-270] (See Dillard Exhibits Nos. C and D. pp. 66-67.) But\r\nthe testimony of these employees,[C4-271] together with photographs\r\nsubsequently taken of them at the scene of the assassination,[C4-272]\r\nestablishes that they were either squatting or kneeling. (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 485, p. 69.) Since the window ledges in the\r\nDepository Building are lower than in most buildings,[C4-273] a person\r\nsquatting or kneeling exposes more of his body than would normally be\r\nthe case. From the street, this creates the impression that the person\r\nis standing. Brennan could have seen enough of the body of a kneeling\r\nor squatting person to estimate his height.\r\n\r\nShortly after the assassination Brennan noticed two of these employees\r\nleaving the building and immediately identified them as having been\r\nin the fifth-floor windows.[C4-274] When the three employees appeared\r\nbefore the Commission, Brennan identified the two whom he saw leave the\r\nbuilding.[C4-275] The two men, Harold Norman and James Jarman, Jr.,\r\neach confirmed that when they came out of the building, they saw and\r\nheard Brennan describing what he had seen.", "start_char_idx": 384373, "end_char_idx": 388333, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4665f0d-1aac-477b-8e5f-5f2fb4a19bcd": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4665f0d-1aac-477b-8e5f-5f2fb4a19bcd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "24c4de03-6168-4eb4-916b-54c8ab61165b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "66164788d5df352e78f3381ce686a3d1210013069e09e4932d55769238d73256", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "79c71531-9fe2-482b-93d7-de75cb946b99", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1c954da23604fa39ad63123038dec784b37dec930503174ff0f97fef5c0f8ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 485, p. 69.)

But I cannot recall any change in expression of any kind\r\non his face.\u201d[C4-355] Truly thought that the officer\u2019s gun at that time\r\nappeared to be almost touching the middle portion of Oswald\u2019s body.\r\nTruly also noted at this time that Oswald\u2019s hands were empty.[C4-356]\r\n\r\nIn an effort to determine whether Oswald could have descended to the\r\nlunchroom from the sixth floor by the time Baker and Truly arrived,\r\nCommission counsel asked Baker and Truly to repeat their movements from\r\nthe time of the shot until Baker came upon Oswald in the lunchroom.\r\nBaker placed himself on a motorcycle about 200 feet from the corner\r\nof Elm and Houston Streets where he said he heard the shots.[C4-357]\r\nTruly stood in front of the building.[C4-358] At a given signal, they\r\nreenacted the event.", "start_char_idx": 400829, "end_char_idx": 404790, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df533f22-4acb-443a-81c0-e87d908b0f88": {"__data__": {"id_": "df533f22-4acb-443a-81c0-e87d908b0f88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "82a98044-5386-436a-994c-f0521dd83879", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "02a531929136f328c349135d15afb041cb6ebfa01290d47d77aa66aed828ba06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2394187-d9a7-4355-9ae6-5e1cfed56ac5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "84117840e628206902549bcb278a70f4b0b243f39d75abdcd96edd227e0c839a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "But I cannot recall any change in expression of any kind\r\non his face.\u201d[C4-355] Truly thought that the officer\u2019s gun at that time\r\nappeared to be almost touching the middle portion of Oswald\u2019s body.\r\nTruly also noted at this time that Oswald\u2019s hands were empty.[C4-356]\r\n\r\nIn an effort to determine whether Oswald could have descended to the\r\nlunchroom from the sixth floor by the time Baker and Truly arrived,\r\nCommission counsel asked Baker and Truly to repeat their movements from\r\nthe time of the shot until Baker came upon Oswald in the lunchroom.\r\nBaker placed himself on a motorcycle about 200 feet from the corner\r\nof Elm and Houston Streets where he said he heard the shots.[C4-357]\r\nTruly stood in front of the building.[C4-358] At a given signal, they\r\nreenacted the event. Baker\u2019s movements were timed with a stopwatch. On\r\nthe first test, the elapsed time between the simulated first shot and\r\nBaker\u2019s arrival on the second-floor stair landing was 1 minute and 30\r\nseconds. The second test run required 1 minute and 15 seconds.[C4-359]\r\n\r\nA test was also conducted to determine the time required to walk from\r\nthe southeast corner of the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom\r\nby stairway. Special Agent John Howlett of the Secret Service carried\r\na rifle from the southeast corner of the sixth floor along the east\r\naisle to the northeast corner. He placed the rifle on the floor near\r\nthe site where Oswald\u2019s rifle was actually found after the shooting.\r\nThen Howlett walked down the stairway to the second-floor landing and\r\nentered the lunchroom. The first test, run at normal walking pace,\r\nrequired 1 minute, 18 seconds;[C4-360] the second test, at a \u201cfast\r\nwalk\u201d took 1 minute, 14 seconds.[C4-361] The second test followed\r\nimmediately after the first. The only interval was the time necessary\r\nto ride in the elevator from the second to the sixth floor and walk\r\nback to the southeast corner. Howlett was not short winded at the end\r\nof either test run.[C4-362]\r\n\r\nThe minimum time required by Baker to park his motorcycle and reach\r\nthe second-floor lunchroom was within 3 seconds of the time needed to\r\nwalk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down the stairway to\r\nthe lunchroom. The time actually required for Baker and Truly to reach\r\nthe second floor on November 22 was probably longer than in the test\r\nruns. For example, Baker required 15 seconds after the simulated shot\r\nto ride his motorcycle 180 to 200 feet, park it, and run 45 feet to the\r\nbuilding.[C4-363] No allowance was made for the special conditions\r\nwhich existed on the day of the assassination--possible delayed\r\nreaction to the shot, jostling with the crowd of people on the steps\r\nand scanning the area along Elm Street and the parkway.[C4-364] Baker\r\nsaid, \u201cWe simulated the shots and by the time we got there, we did\r\neverything that I did that day, and this would be the minimum, because\r\nI am sure that I, you know, it took me a little longer.\u201d[C4-365] On\r\nthe basis of this time test, therefore, the Commission concluded that\r\nOswald could have fired the shots and still have been present in the\r\nsecond-floor lunchroom when seen by Baker and Truly.\r\n\r\nThat Oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the\r\nsecond-floor lunchroom is consistent with the movements of the two\r\nelevators, which would have provided the other possible means of\r\ndescent. When Truly, accompanied by Baker, ran to the rear of the\r\nfirst floor, he was certain that both elevators, which occupy the same\r\nshaft,[C4-366] were on the fifth floor.[C4-367] Baker, not realizing\r\nthat there were two elevators, thought that only one elevator was\r\nin the shaft and that it was two or three floors above the second\r\nfloor.[C4-368] In the few seconds which elapsed while Baker and Truly\r\nran from the first to the second floor, neither of these slow elevators\r\ncould have descended from the fifth to the second floor. Furthermore,\r\nno elevator was at the second floor when they arrived there.[C4-369]\r\nTruly and Baker continued up the stairs after the encounter with Oswald\r\nin the lunchroom.

There was no elevator on the third or fourth floor.\r\nThe east elevator was on the fifth floor when they arrived; the west\r\nelevator was not. They took the east elevator to the seventh floor\r\nand ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several\r\nminutes.[C4-370]\r\n\r\nJack Dougherty, an employee working on the fifth floor, testified\r\nthat he took the west elevator to the first floor after hearing a\r\nnoise which sounded like a backfire.[C4-371] Eddie Piper, the janitor,\r\ntold Dougherty that the President had been shot,[C4-372] but in his\r\ntestimony Piper did not mention either seeing or talking with Dougherty\r\nduring these moments of excitement.[C4-373] Both Dougherty and Piper\r\nwere confused witnesses. They had no exact memory of the events of that\r\nafternoon. Truly was probably correct in stating that the west elevator\r\nwas on the fifth floor when he looked up the elevator shaft from the\r\nfirst floor. The west elevator was not on the fifth floor when Baker\r\nand Truly reached that floor, probably because Jack Dougherty took it\r\nto the first floor while Baker and Truly were running up the stairs or\r\nin the lunchroom with Oswald. Neither elevator could have been used by\r\nOswald as a means of descent.\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other\r\nemployees in the building. Three employees--James Jarman, Jr., Harold\r\nNorman, and Bonnie Ray Williams--were watching the parade from the\r\nfifth floor, directly below the window from which the shots were fired.\r\nThey rushed to the west windows after the shots were fired and remained\r\nthere until after they saw Patrolman Baker\u2019s white helmet on the fifth\r\nfloor moving toward the elevator.[C4-374] While they were at the west\r\nwindows their view of the stairwell was completely blocked by shelves\r\nand boxes.[C4-375] This is the period during which Oswald would have\r\ndescended the stairs. In all likelihood Dougherty took the elevator\r\ndown from the fifth floor after Jarman, Norman, and Williams ran to the\r\nwest windows and were deciding what to do. None of these three men saw\r\nDougherty, probably because of the anxiety of the moment and because\r\nof the books which may have blocked the view.[C4-376] Neither Jarman,\r\nNorman, Williams, or Dougherty saw Oswald.[C4-377]\r\n\r\nVictoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository\r\nBuilding, claimed that within about 1 minute following the shots she\r\nran from a window on the south side of the fourth floor,[C4-378]\r\ndown the rear stairs to the first floor, where she encountered two\r\nDepository employees--William Shelley and Billy Lovelady.[C4-379] If\r\nher estimate of time is correct, she reached the bottom of the stairs\r\nbefore Truly and Baker started up, and she must have run down the\r\nstairs ahead of Oswald and would probably have seen or heard him.\r\nActually she noticed no one on the back stairs.

Reid, clerical\r\nsupervisor for the Texas School Book Depository, saw him walk through\r\nthe clerical office on the second floor toward the door leading to the\r\nfront stairway. Mrs. Reid had watched the parade from the sidewalk in\r\nfront of the building with Truly and Mr. O.\u00a0V. Campbell, vice president\r\nof the Depository.[C4-385] She testified that she heard three shots\r\nwhich she thought came from the building.[C4-386] She ran inside and\r\nup the front stairs into the large open office reserved for clerical\r\nemployees. As she approached her desk, she saw Oswald.[C4-387] He\r\nwas walking into the office from the back hallway, carrying a full\r\nbottle of Coca-Cola in his hand,[C4-388] presumably purchased after\r\nthe encounter with Baker and Truly. As Oswald passed Mrs. Reid she\r\nsaid, \u201cOh, the President has been shot, but maybe they didn\u2019t hit\r\nhim.\u201d[C4-389] Oswald mumbled something and walked by.[C4-390] She\r\npaid no more attention to him. The only exit from the office in\r\nthe direction Oswald was moving was through the door to the front\r\nstairway.[C4-391] (See Commission Exhibit 1118, p. 150.) Mrs. Reid\r\ntestified that when she saw Oswald, he was wearing a T-shirt and no\r\njacket.[C4-392] When he left home that morning, Marina Oswald, who\r\nwas still in bed, suggested that he wear a jacket.[C4-393] A blue\r\njacket, later identified by Marina Oswald as her husband\u2019s,[C4-394] was\r\nsubsequently found in the building,[C4-395] apparently left behind by\r\nOswald.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reid believes that she returned to her desk from the street about\r\n2 minutes after the shooting.[C4-396] Reconstructing her movements,\r\nMrs. Reid ran the distance three times and was timed in 2 minutes by\r\nstopwatch.[C4-397] The reconstruction was the minimum time.[C4-398]\r\nAccordingly, she probably met Oswald at about 12:32, approximately\r\n30-45 seconds after Oswald\u2019s lunchroom encounter with Baker and Truly.\r\nAfter leaving Mrs. Reid in the front office, Oswald could have gone\r\ndown the stairs and out the front door by 12:33 p.m.[C4-399]--3 minutes\r\nafter the shooting. At that time the building had not yet been sealed\r\noff by the police.\r\n\r\nWhile it was difficult to determine exactly when the police sealed off\r\nthe building, the earliest estimates would still have permitted Oswald\r\nto leave the building by 12:33.

At that time the building had not yet been sealed\r\noff by the police.\r\n\r\nWhile it was difficult to determine exactly when the police sealed off\r\nthe building, the earliest estimates would still have permitted Oswald\r\nto leave the building by 12:33. One of the police officers assigned to\r\nthe corner of Elm and Houston Streets for the Presidential motorcade,\r\nW.E. Barnett, testified that immediately after the shots he went to\r\nthe rear of the building to check the fire escape. He then returned to\r\nthe corner of Elm and Houston where he met a sergeant who instructed\r\nhim to find out the name of the building. Barnett ran to the building,\r\nnoted its name, and then returned to the corner.[C4-400] There he was\r\nmet by a construction worker--in all likelihood Howard Brennan, who\r\nwas wearing his work helmet.[C4-401] This worker told Barnett that\r\nthe shots had been fired from a window in the Depository Building,\r\nwhereupon Barnett posted himself at the front door to make certain that\r\nno one left the building. The sergeant did the same thing at the rear\r\nof the building.[C4-402] Barnett estimated that approximately 3 minutes\r\nelapsed between the time he heard the last of the shots and the time\r\nhe started guarding the front door. According to Barnett, \u201cthere were\r\npeople going in and out\u201d during this period.[C4-403]\r\n\r\nSgt. D.\u00a0V. Harkness of the Dallas police said that to his knowledge\r\nthe building was not sealed off at 12:36 p.m. when he called in on\r\npolice radio that a witness (Amos Euins) had seen shots fired from a\r\nwindow of the building.[C4-404] At that time, Inspector Herbert V.\r\nSawyer\u2019s car was parked in front of the building.[C4-405] Harkness did\r\nnot know whether or not two officers with Sawyer were guarding the\r\ndoors.[C4-406] At 12:34 p.m. Sawyer heard a call over the police radio\r\nthat the shots had come from the Depository Building.[C4-407] He then\r\nentered the building and took the front passenger elevator as far as\r\nit would go--the fourth floor.[C4-408] After inspecting this floor,\r\nSawyer returned to the street about 3 minutes after he entered the\r\nbuilding.[C4-409] After he returned to the street he directed Sergeant\r\nHarkness to station two patrolmen at the front door and not let anyone\r\nin or out; he also directed that the back door be sealed off.[C4-410]\r\nThis was no earlier than 12:37 p.m.[C4-411] and may have been later.\r\nSpecial Agent Forrest V. Sorrels of the Secret Service, who had been\r\nin the motorcade, testified that after driving to Parkland Hospital,\r\nhe returned to the Depository Building about 20 minutes after the\r\nshooting, found no police officers at the rear door and was able to\r\nenter through this door without identifying himself.[C4-412]\r\n\r\nAlthough Oswald probably left the building at about 12:33 p.m., his\r\nabsence was not noticed until at least one-half hour later.

Oswald was seen in the vicinity\r\nof the southeast corner of the sixth floor approximately 35 minutes\r\nbefore the assassination and no one could be found who saw Oswald\r\nanywhere else in the building until after the shooting. An eyewitness\r\nto the shooting immediately provided a description of the man in the\r\nwindow which was similar to Oswald\u2019s actual appearance. This witness\r\nidentified Oswald in a lineup as the man most nearly resembling the man\r\nhe saw and later identified Oswald as the man he observed. Oswald\u2019s\r\nknown actions in the building immediately after the assassination are\r\nconsistent with his having been at the southeast corner window of the\r\nsixth floor at 12:30 p.m. On the basis of these findings the Commission\r\nhas concluded that Oswald, at the time of the assassination, was\r\npresent at the window from which the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KILLING OF PATROLMAN J.\u00a0D. TIPPIT\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Depository Building at approximately 12:33 p.m.,\r\nLee Harvey Oswald proceeded to his roominghouse by bus and taxi. He\r\narrived at approximately 1 p.m. and left a few minutes later. At about\r\n1:16 p.m., a Dallas police officer, J.\u00a0D. Tippit, was shot less than\r\n1 mile from Oswald\u2019s roominghouse. In deciding whether Oswald killed\r\nPatrolman Tippit the Commission considered the following: (1) positive\r\nidentification of the killer by two eyewitnesses who saw the shooting\r\nand seven eyewitnesses who heard the shots and saw the gunman flee\r\nthe scene with the revolver in his hand, (2) testimony of firearms\r\nidentification experts establishing the identity of the murder weapon,\r\n(3) evidence establishing the ownership of the murder weapon, (4)\r\nevidence establishing the ownership of a zipper jacket found along the\r\npath of flight taken by the gunman from the scene of the shooting to\r\nthe place of arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald\u2019s Movements After Leaving Depository Building\r\n\r\n_The bus ride._--According to the reconstruction of time and events\r\nwhich the Commission found most credible, Lee Harvey Oswald left the\r\nbuilding approximately 3 minutes after the assassination. He probably\r\nwalked east on Elm Street for seven blocks to the corner of Elm and\r\nMurphy where he boarded a bus which was heading back in the direction\r\nof the Depository Building, on its way to the Oak Cliff section of\r\nDallas.

As the bus neared Lamar Street, Oswald left the bus and\r\ndisappeared into the crowd.[C4-439]\r\n\r\nThe Marsalis bus which Oswald boarded traveled a route west on Elm,\r\nsouth on Houston, and southwest across the Houston viaduct to service\r\nthe Oak Cliff area along Marsalis.[C4-440] A Beckley bus which also\r\nserved the Oak Cliff area, followed the same route as the Marsalis\r\nbus through downtown Dallas, except that it continued west on Elm,\r\nacross Houston in front of the Depository Building, past the Triple\r\nUnderpass into west Dallas, and south on Beckley.[C4-441] Marsalis\r\nStreet is seven blocks from Beckley.[C4-442] Oswald lived at 1026 North\r\nBeckley.[C4-443] He could not reach his roominghouse on the Marsalis\r\nbus, but the Beckley bus stopped across the street.[C4-444] According\r\nto McWatters, the Beckley bus was behind the Marsalis bus, but he did\r\nnot actually see it.[C4-445] Both buses stopped within one block of the\r\nDepository Building. Instead of waiting there, Oswald apparently went\r\nas far away as he could and boarded the first Oak Cliff bus which came\r\nalong rather than wait for one which stopped across the street from his\r\nroominghouse.\r\n\r\nIn a reconstruction of this bus trip, agents of the Secret Service\r\nand the FBI walked the seven blocks from the front entrance of the\r\nDepository Building to Murphy and Elm three times, averaging 6\u00bd minutes\r\nfor the three trips.[C4-446] A bus moving through heavy traffic on\r\nElm from Murphy to Lamar was timed at 4 minutes.[C4-447] If Oswald\r\nleft the Depository Building at 12:33 p.m., walked seven blocks\r\ndirectly to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately, he\r\nwould have boarded the bus at approximately 12:40 p.m. and left it at\r\napproximately 12:44 p.m. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.)\r\n\r\nRoger D. Craig, a deputy sheriff of Dallas County, claimed that\r\nabout 15 minutes after the assassination he saw a man, whom he later\r\nidentified as Oswald,[C4-448] coming from the direction of the\r\nDepository Building and running down the hill north of Elm Street\r\ntoward a light-colored Rambler station wagon, which was moving slowly\r\nalong Elm toward the underpass.", "start_char_idx": 423869, "end_char_idx": 427669, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8ba8229-f196-40da-b0d1-865b7e52e9d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8ba8229-f196-40da-b0d1-865b7e52e9d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d567cc3-5f54-4728-94b9-c6ed93c5c90a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "22294ef6ba0c901caf249ea680e1f1fae53d1e78aba05b0551800e7b6fcb71b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "73ac297f-12af-4243-9644-cd5ce823e3d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6f7be7f4854bca134d4f21b0af180d787be572bc2c7dfb92629a56ae30018f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C4-446] A bus moving through heavy traffic on\r\nElm from Murphy to Lamar was timed at 4 minutes.[C4-447] If Oswald\r\nleft the Depository Building at 12:33 p.m., walked seven blocks\r\ndirectly to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately, he\r\nwould have boarded the bus at approximately 12:40 p.m. and left it at\r\napproximately 12:44 p.m. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.)\r\n\r\nRoger D.

Captain Fritz stated that a deputy sheriff whom he could\r\nnot identify did ask to see him that afternoon and told him a similar\r\nstory to Craig\u2019s.[C4-453] Fritz did not bring him into his office\r\nto identify Oswald but turned him over to Lieutenant Baker for\r\nquestioning. If Craig saw Oswald that afternoon, he saw him through the\r\nglass windows of the office. And neither Captain Fritz nor any other\r\nofficer can remember that Oswald dramatically arose from his chair\r\nand said, \u201cEverybody will know who I am now.\u201d[C4-454] If Oswald had\r\nmade such a statement, Captain Fritz and others present would probably\r\nhave remembered it. Craig may have seen a person enter a white Rambler\r\nstation wagon 15 or 20 minutes after the shooting and travel west on\r\nElm Street, but the Commission concluded that this man was not Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald, because of the overwhelming evidence that Oswald was far\r\naway from the building by that time.\r\n\r\n_The taxicab ride._--William Whaley, a taxicab driver, told his\r\nemployer on Saturday morning, November 23, that he recognized Oswald\r\nfrom a newspaper photograph as a man whom he had driven to the Oak\r\nCliff area the day before.[C4-455] Notified of Whaley\u2019s statement, the\r\npolice brought him to the police station that afternoon. He was taken\r\nto the lineup room where, according to Whaley, five young teenagers,\r\nall handcuffed together, were displayed with Oswald.[C4-456] He\r\ntestified that Oswald looked older than the other boys.[C4-457] The\r\npolice asked him whether he could pick out his passenger from the\r\nlineup. Whaley picked Oswald. He said,\r\n\r\n    * * * you could have picked him out without identifying him by\r\n    just listening to him because he was bawling out the policeman,\r\n    telling them it wasn\u2019t right to put him in line with these\r\n    teenagers and all of that and they asked me which one and I\r\n    told them. It was him all right, the same man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He showed no respect for the policemen, he told them what he\r\n    thought about them. They knew what they were doing and they\r\n    were trying to railroad him and he wanted his lawyer.[C4-458]\r\n\r\nWhaley believes that Oswald\u2019s conduct did not aid him in his\r\nidentification \u201cbecause I knew he was the right one as soon as I saw\r\nhim.\u201d[C4-459]\r\n\r\nWhaley\u2019s memory of the lineup is inaccurate.

The man was dressed in faded\r\nblue color khaki work clothes, a brown shirt, and some kind of work\r\njacket that almost matched his pants.[C4-466] The man asked, \u201cMay I\r\nhave the cab?\u201d, and got into the front seat.[C4-467] Whaley described\r\nthe ensuing events as follows:\r\n\r\n    And about that time an old lady, I think she was an old lady,\r\n    I don\u2019t remember nothing but her sticking her head down past\r\n    him in the door and said, \u201cDriver, will you call me a cab down\r\n    here?\u201d\r\n\r\n    She had seen him get this cab and she wanted one, too, and he\r\n    opened the door a little bit like he was going to get out and\r\n    he said, \u201cI will let you have this one,\u201d and she says, \u201cNo, the\r\n    driver can call me one.\u201d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    * * * I asked him where he wanted to go. And he said, \u201c500\r\n    North Beckley.\u201d\r\n\r\n    Well, I started up, I started to that address, and the police\r\n    cars, the sirens was going, running crisscrossing everywhere,\r\n    just a big uproar in that end of town and I said, \u201cWhat the\r\n    hell. I wonder what the hell is the uproar?\u201d\r\n\r\n    And he never said anything. So I figured he was one of these\r\n    people that don\u2019t like to talk so I never said any more to him.\r\n\r\n    But when I got pretty close to 500 block at Neches and North\r\n    Beckley which is the 500 block, he said, \u201cThis will do fine,\u201d\r\n    and I pulled over to the curb right there. He gave me a dollar\r\n    bill, the trip was 95 cents. He gave me a dollar bill and\r\n    didn\u2019t say anything, just got out and closed the door and\r\n    walked around the front of the cab over to the other side of\r\n    the street [east side of the street].

The 500 block of North Beckley is five blocks south of the\r\nroominghouse.[C4-471]\r\n\r\nAfter a review of these inconsistencies in his testimony before the\r\nCommission, Whaley was interviewed again in Dallas. The route of the\r\ntaxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.[C4-472] He directed\r\nthe driver of the car to a point 20 feet north of the northwest\r\ncorner of the intersection of Beckley and Neely, the point at which\r\nhe said his passenger alighted.[C4-473] This was the 700 block of\r\nNorth Beckley.[C4-474] The elapsed time of the reconstructed run from\r\nthe Greyhound Bus Station to Neely and Beckley was 5 minutes and 30\r\nseconds by stopwatch.[C4-475] The walk from Beckley and Neely to 1026\r\nNorth Beckley was timed by Commission counsel at 5 minutes and 45\r\nseconds.[C4-476]\r\n\r\nWhaley testified that Oswald was wearing either the gray zippered\r\njacket or the heavy blue jacket.[C4-477] He was in error, however.\r\nOswald could not possibly have been wearing the blue jacket during\r\nthe trip with Whaley, since it was found in the \u201cdomino\u201d room of\r\nthe Depository late in November.[C4-478] Moreover, Mrs. Bledsoe saw\r\nOswald in the bus without a jacket and wearing a shirt with a hole at\r\nthe elbow.[C4-479] On the other hand, Whaley identified Commission\r\nExhibit No. 150 (the shirt taken from Oswald upon arrest) as the shirt\r\nhis passenger was wearing.[C4-480] He also stated he saw a silver\r\nidentification bracelet on his passenger\u2019s left wrist.[C4-481] Oswald\r\nwas wearing such a bracelet when he was arrested.[C4-482]\r\n\r\nOn November 22, Oswald told Captain Fritz that he rode a bus to a stop\r\nnear his home and then walked to his roominghouse.[C4-483] When queried\r\nthe following morning concerning a bus transfer found in his possession\r\nat the time of his arrest, he admitted receiving it.[C4-484] And when\r\ninterrogated about a cab ride, Oswald also admitted that he left the\r\nslow-moving bus and took a cab to his roominghouse.[C4-485]\r\n\r\nThe Greyhound Bus Station at Lamar and Jackson Streets, where Oswald\r\nentered Whaley\u2019s cab, is three to four short blocks south of Lamar and\r\nElm.[C4-486] If Oswald left the bus at 12:44 p.m. and walked directly\r\nto the terminal, he would have entered the cab at 12:47 or 12:48 p.m.\r\nIf the cab ride was approximately 6 minutes, as was the reconstructed\r\nride, he would have reached his destination at approximately 12:54\r\np.m. If he was discharged at Neely and Beckley and walked directly to\r\nhis roominghouse, he would have arrived there about 12:59 to 1 p.m.\r\nFrom the 500 block of North Beckley, the walk would be a few minutes\r\nlonger, but in either event he would have been in the roominghouse at\r\nabout 1 p.m. This is the approximate time he entered the roominghouse,\r\naccording to Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper there.[C4-487] (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.)\r\n\r\n_Arrival and departure from roominghouse._--Earlene Roberts,\r\nhousekeeper for Mrs. A.C.

A sixth did so the next day.\r\nThree others subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph. Two\r\nwitnesses testified that Oswald resembled the man they had seen. One\r\nwitness felt he was too distant from the gunman to make a positive\r\nidentification. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p. 164.)\r\n\r\nA taxi driver, William Scoggins, was eating lunch in his cab which\r\nwas parked on Patton facing the southeast corner of 10th Street and\r\nPatton Avenue a few feet to the north.[C4-503] A police car moving\r\neast on 10th at about 10 or 12 miles an hour passed in front of his\r\ncab. About 100 feet from the corner the police car pulled up alongside\r\na man on the sidewalk. This man, dressed in a light-colored jacket,\r\napproached the car. Scoggins lost sight of him behind some shrubbery\r\non the southeast corner lot, but he saw the policeman leave the car,\r\nheard three or four shots, and then saw the policeman fall. Scoggins\r\nhurriedly left his seat and hid behind the cab as the man came back\r\ntoward the corner with gun in hand. The man cut across the yard through\r\nsome bushes, passed within 12 feet of Scoggins, and ran south on\r\nPatton. Scoggins saw him and heard him mutter either \u201cPoor damn cop\u201d\r\nor \u201cPoor dumb cop.\u201d[C4-504] The next day Scoggins viewed a lineup of\r\nfour persons and identified Oswald as the man whom he had seen the\r\nday before at 10th and Patton.[C4-505] In his testimony before the\r\nCommission, Scoggins stated that he thought he had seen a picture\r\nof Oswald in the newspapers prior to the lineup identification on\r\nSaturday.

When questioned by police officers on the\r\nevening of November 22, Benavides told them that he did not think that\r\nhe could identify the man who fired the shots. As a result, they did\r\nnot take him to the police station. He testified that the picture of\r\nOswald which he saw later on television bore a resemblance to the man\r\nwho shot Officer Tippit.[C4-510]\r\n\r\nJust prior to the shooting, Mrs. Helen Markham, a waitress in\r\ndowntown Dallas, was about to cross 10th Street at Patton.

The man continued along 10th Street. Mrs.\r\nMarkham saw a police car slowly approach the man from the rear and\r\nstop alongside of him. She saw the man come to the right window of the\r\npolice car. As he talked, he leaned on the ledge of the right window\r\nwith his arms. The man appeared to step back as the policeman \u201ccalmly\r\nopened the car door\u201d and very slowly got out and walked toward the\r\nfront of the car. The man pulled a gun. Mrs. Markham heard three shots\r\nand saw the policeman fall to the ground near the left front wheel. She\r\nraised her hands to her eyes as the man started to walk back toward\r\nPatton.[C4-513] She peered through her fingers, lowered her hands, and\r\nsaw the man doing something with his gun. \u201cHe was just fooling with it.\r\nI didn\u2019t know what he was doing.

She\r\nstated that the man weighed about 150 pounds.[C4-526] Although she\r\nused the words \u201ca little bit bushy\u201d to describe the gunman\u2019s hair,\r\nthe transcript establishes that she was referring to the uncombed\r\nstate of his hair, a description fully supported by a photograph of\r\nOswald taken at the time of his arrest.

Although in the phone conversation she described the man as\r\n\u201cshort,\u201d[C4-527] on November 22, within minutes of the shooting and\r\nbefore the lineup, Mrs. Markham described the man to the police as 5\u20198\u201d\r\ntall.[C4-528]\r\n\r\nDuring her testimony Mrs. Markham initially denied that she ever had\r\nthe above phone conversation.[C4-529] She has subsequently admitted\r\nthe existence of the conversation and offered an explanation for her\r\ndenial.[C4-530] Addressing itself solely to the probative value of Mrs.\r\nMarkham\u2019s contemporaneous description of the gunman and her positive\r\nidentification of Oswald at a police lineup, the Commission considers\r\nher testimony reliable. However, even in the absence of Mrs. Markham\u2019s\r\ntestimony, there is ample evidence to identify Oswald as the killer of\r\nTippit.\r\n\r\nTwo young women, Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis, were in an\r\napartment of a multiple-unit house on the southeast corner of 10th and\r\nPatton when they heard the sound of gunfire and the screams of Helen\r\nMarkham. They ran to the door in time to see a man with a revolver\r\ncut across their lawn and disappear around a corner of the house onto\r\nPatton.[C4-531] Barbara Jeanette Davis assumed that he was emptying his\r\ngun as \u201che had it open and was shaking it.\u201d[C4-532] She immediately\r\ncalled the police.

He looked west on 10th and saw a man running to the\r\nwest and a policeman falling to the ground. Smith failed to make\r\nhimself known to the police on November 22. Several days later he\r\nreported what he had seen and was questioned by FBI agents.[C4-542]\r\nSmith subsequently told a Commission staff member that he saw Oswald\r\non television the night of the murder and thought that Oswald was the\r\nman he had seen running away from the shooting.[C4-543] On television\r\nOswald\u2019s hair looked blond, whereas Smith remembered that the man\r\nwho ran away had hair that was brown or brownish black. Later, the\r\nFBI showed Smith a picture of Oswald. In the picture the hair was\r\nbrown.[C4-544] According to his testimony, Smith told the FBI, \u201cIt\r\nlooked more like him than it did on television.\u201d He stated further\r\nthat from \u201cWhat I saw of him\u201d the man looked like the man in the\r\npicture.[C4-545]\r\n\r\nTwo other important eyewitnesses to Oswald\u2019s flight were Ted Callaway,\r\nmanager of a used-car lot on the northeast corner of Patton Avenue\r\nand Jefferson Boulevard, and Sam Guinyard, a porter at the lot. They\r\nheard the sound of shots to the north of their lot.[C4-546] Callaway\r\nheard five shots, and Guinyard three. Both ran to the sidewalk on the\r\neast side of Patton at a point about a half a block south of 10th.\r\nThey saw a man coming south on Patton with a revolver held high in his\r\nright hand.

Reynolds and\r\nPatterson decided to follow him. When he reached a gasoline service\r\nstation one block away he turned north and walked toward a parking\r\narea in the rear of the station. Neither Reynolds nor Patterson saw\r\nthe man after he turned off Jefferson at the service station.[C4-564]\r\nThese four witnesses were interviewed by FBI agents 2 months after\r\nthe shooting. Russell and Patterson were shown a picture of Oswald\r\nand they stated that Oswald was the man they saw on November 22,\r\n1963. Russell confirmed this statement in a sworn affidavit for\r\nthe Commission.[C4-565] Patterson, when asked later to confirm his\r\nidentification by affidavit said he did not recall having been shown\r\nthe photograph. He was then shown two photographs of Oswald and he\r\nadvised that Oswald was \u201cunquestionably\u201d the man he saw.[C4-566]\r\nReynolds did not make a positive identification when interviewed by the\r\nFBI, but he subsequently testified before a Commission staff member\r\nand, when shown two photographs of Oswald, stated that they were\r\nphotographs of the man he saw.[C4-567] L.\u00a0J.

This caused the\r\nbullets to have an erratic passage through the barrel and impressed\r\nupon the lead of the bullets inconsistent individual characteristics\r\nwhich made identification impossible. Consecutive bullets fired from\r\nthe revolver by the FBI experts could not be identified as having been\r\nfired from that revolver.[C4-575] (See app. X, p. 559.)

All four bullets were fired from a weapon\r\nwith five lands and grooves and a right twist[C4-576] which were\r\nthe rifling characteristics of the revolver taken from Oswald. He\r\nconcluded, however, that he could not say whether the four bullets\r\nwere fired from the revolver in Oswald\u2019s possession.[C4-577] \u201cThe only\r\nthing I can testify is they could have on the basis of the rifling\r\ncharacteristics--they could have been.\u201d[C4-578]\r\n\r\nNicol differed with the FBI experts on one bullet taken from Tippit\u2019s\r\nbody. He declared that this bullet[C4-579] was fired from the same\r\nweapon that fired the test bullets to the exclusion of all other\r\nweapons. But he agreed that because the other three bullets were\r\nmutilated, he could not determine if they had been fired from the same\r\nweapon as the test bullets.[C4-580]\r\n\r\nThe examination and testimony of the experts enabled the Commission to\r\nconclude that five shots may have been fired, even though only four\r\nbullets were recovered. Three of the bullets recovered from Tippit\u2019s\r\nbody were manufactured by Winchester-Western, and the fourth bullet\r\nby Remington-Peters, but only two of the four discarded cartridge\r\ncases found on the lawn at 10th Street and Patton Avenue were of\r\nWinchester-Western manufacture.[C4-581] Therefore, one cartridge\r\ncase of this type was not recovered. And though only one bullet of\r\nRemington-Peters manufacture was recovered, two empty cartridge\r\ncases of that make were retrieved. Therefore, either one bullet of\r\nRemington-Peters manufacture is missing or one used Remington-Peters\r\ncartridge case, which may have been in the revolver before the\r\nshooting, was discarded along with the others as Oswald left the scene.\r\nIf a bullet is missing, five were fired.

Mrs.\r\nEarlene Roberts, the housekeeper at Oswald\u2019s roominghouse and the last\r\nperson known to have seen him before he reached 10th Street and Patton\r\nAvenue, said that she may have seen the gray zipper jacket but she was\r\nnot certain. It seemed to her that the jacket Oswald wore was darker\r\nthan Commission Exhibit No. 162.[C4-611] Ted Callaway, who saw the\r\ngunman moments after the shooting, testified that Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 162 looked like the jacket he was wearing but \u201cI thought it had a\r\nlittle more tan to it.\u201d[C4-612] Two other witnesses, Sam Guinyard and\r\nWilliam Arthur Smith, testified that Commission Exhibit No. 162 was\r\nthe jacket worn by the man they saw on November 22.

These facts warrant the finding that Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald disposed of his jacket as he fled from the scene of the\r\nTippit killing.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe foregoing evidence establishes that (1) two eyewitnesses who heard\r\nthe shots and saw the shooting of Dallas Police Patrolman J.\u00a0D. Tippit\r\nand seven eyewitnesses who saw the flight of the gunman with revolver\r\nin hand positively identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw\r\nfire the shots or flee from the scene, (2) the cartridge cases found\r\nnear the scene of the shooting were fired from the revolver in the\r\npossession of Oswald at the time of his arrest, to the exclusion of all\r\nother weapons, (3) the revolver in Oswald\u2019s possession at the time of\r\nhis arrest was purchased by and belonged to Oswald, and (4) Oswald\u2019s\r\njacket was found along the path of flight taken by the gunman as he\r\nfled from the scene of the killing. On the basis of this evidence\r\nthe Commission concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Dallas Police\r\nPatrolman J.D.

Throughout\r\nthis interrogation he denied that he had anything to do either with\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy or the murder of Patrolman\r\nTippit. Captain Fritz of the homicide and robbery bureau did most of\r\nthe questioning, but he kept no notes and there were no stenographic\r\nor tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies\r\nwere also present, including the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service. They\r\noccasionally participated in the questioning. The reports prepared by\r\nthose present at these interviews are set forth in appendix XI. A full\r\ndiscussion of Oswald\u2019s detention and interrogation is presented in\r\nchapter V of this report.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening of November 22, the Dallas Police Department\r\nperformed paraffin tests on Oswald\u2019s hands and right cheek in an\r\napparent effort to determine, by means of a scientific test, whether\r\nOswald had recently fired a weapon. The results were positive for\r\nthe hands and negative for the right cheek.[C4-669] Expert testimony\r\nbefore the Commission was to the effect that the paraffin test was\r\nunreliable[C4-670] in determining whether or not a person has fired a\r\nrifle or revolver.[C4-671] The Commission has, therefore, placed no\r\nreliance on the paraffin tests administered by the Dallas police. (See\r\napp. X, pp. 561-562.)\r\n\r\nOswald provided little information during his questioning. Frequently,\r\nhowever, he was confronted with evidence which he could not explain,\r\nand he resorted to statements which are known to be lies.[C4-672] While\r\nOswald\u2019s untrue statements during interrogation were not considered\r\nitems of positive proof by the Commission, they had probative value in\r\ndeciding the weight to be given to his denials that he assassinated\r\nPresident Kennedy and killed Patrolman Tippit. Since independent\r\nevidence revealed that Oswald repeatedly and blatantly lied to the\r\npolice, the Commission gave little weight to his denials of guilt.\r\n\r\n\r\nDenial of Rifle Ownership\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, Oswald denied owning a rifle. On November 23, Fritz\r\nconfronted Oswald with the evidence that he had purchased a rifle under\r\nthe fictitious name of \u201cHidell.\u201d Oswald said that this was not true.\r\nOswald denied that he had a rifle wrapped up in a blanket in the Paine\r\ngarage.", "start_char_idx": 474943, "end_char_idx": 479156, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f26c2d61-b5c3-4082-a905-c75510b78e5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f26c2d61-b5c3-4082-a905-c75510b78e5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a675008-fac6-42b7-a07a-e96a6e537a34", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "fd8a3913955ea91e3ae68324e3085348d8ffe7621cab60afe3ebfc6b6698d531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "81c2cf3e-0f1d-4604-a21c-80ce573c6de3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c76ea11259e00f11156c8df51d8fa6860d3becb56ea624b390684e4ee9c84b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[C4-672] While\r\nOswald\u2019s untrue statements during interrogation were not considered\r\nitems of positive proof by the Commission, they had probative value in\r\ndeciding the weight to be given to his denials that he assassinated\r\nPresident Kennedy and killed Patrolman Tippit.

According to Fritz, Oswald sneered, saying that they were fake\r\nphotographs, that he had been photographed a number of times the day\r\nbefore by the police, that they had superimposed upon the photographs\r\na rifle and a revolver.[C4-675] He told Fritz a number of times that\r\nthe smaller photograph was either made from the larger, or the larger\r\nphotograph was made from the smaller and that at the proper time he\r\nwould show that the pictures were fakes. Fritz told him that the two\r\nsmall photographs were found in the Paine garage. At that point,\r\nOswald refused to answer any further questions.[C4-676] As previously\r\nindicated, Marina Oswald testified that she took the two pictures with\r\nher husband\u2019s Imperial Reflex camera when they lived on Neely Street.\r\nHer testimony was fully supported by a photography expert who testified\r\nthat in his opinion the pictures were not composites.[C4-677]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Revolver\r\n\r\nAt the first interrogation, Oswald claimed that his only crime was\r\ncarrying a gun and resisting arrest. When Captain Fritz asked him why\r\nhe carried the revolver, he answered, \u201cWell, you know about a pistol.\r\nI just carried it.\u201d[C4-678] He falsely alleged that he bought the\r\nrevolver in Fort Worth,[C4-679] when in fact he purchased it from a\r\nmail-order house in Los Angeles.[C4-680]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Aliases \u201cHidell\u201d and \u201cO.\u00a0H. Lee\u201d\r\n\r\nThe arresting officers found a forged selective service card with\r\na picture of Oswald and the name \u201cAlek J. Hidell\u201d in Oswald\u2019s\r\nbillfold.[C4-681] On November 22 and 23, Oswald refused to tell Fritz\r\nwhy this card was in his possession,[C4-682] or to answer any questions\r\nconcerning the card.[C4-683] On Sunday morning, November 24, Oswald\r\ndenied that he knew A.\u00a0J. Hidell. Captain Fritz produced the selective\r\nservice card bearing the name \u201cAlek J. Hidell.\u201d Oswald became angry\r\nand said, \u201cNow, I\u2019ve told you all I\u2019m going to tell you about that\r\ncard in my billfold--you have the card yourself and you know as much\r\nabout it as I do.\u201d[C4-684] At the last interrogation on November 24,\r\nOswald admitted to Postal Inspector Holmes that he had rented post\r\noffice box 2915, Dallas, but denied that he had received a package\r\nin this box addressed to Hidell. He also denied that he had received\r\nthe rifle through this box.[C4-685] Holmes reminded Oswald that A.\u00a0J.\r\nHidell was listed on post office box 30061, New Orleans, as one\r\nentitled to receive mail. Oswald replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about\r\nthat.\u201d[C4-686]\r\n\r\nWhen asked why he lived at his roominghouse under the name O.\u00a0H. Lee,\r\nOswald responded that the landlady simply made a mistake, because he\r\ntold her that his name was Lee, meaning his first name.[C4-687] An\r\nexamination of the roominghouse register revealed that Oswald actually\r\nsigned the name O.\u00a0H.", "start_char_idx": 478403, "end_char_idx": 482429, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81c2cf3e-0f1d-4604-a21c-80ce573c6de3": {"__data__": {"id_": "81c2cf3e-0f1d-4604-a21c-80ce573c6de3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f26c2d61-b5c3-4082-a905-c75510b78e5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "b016c8b72d5d65b85337044431f9f1ce3e66c85f9df0d767a44318be13b7e62f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c0c5638d-9698-47d3-b8d3-dd6cf8a0c81d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "312eaf597353f7e3ff2b5dc2466bd53f031e0ce0c127272672bf93b86d3f1d6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He also denied that he had received\r\nthe rifle through this box.[C4-685] Holmes reminded Oswald that A.\u00a0J.\r\nHidell was listed on post office box 30061, New Orleans, as one\r\nentitled to receive mail.

Lee.[C4-688]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Curtain Rod Story\r\n\r\nIn concluding that Oswald was carrying a rifle in the paper bag on the\r\nmorning of November 22, 1963, the Commission found that Oswald lied\r\nwhen he told Frazier that he was returning to Irving to obtain curtain\r\nrods. When asked about the curtain rod story, Oswald lied again. He\r\ndenied that he had ever told Frazier that he wanted a ride to Irving\r\nto get curtain rods for an apartment.[C4-689] He explained that a\r\nparty for the Paine children had been planned for the weekend and he\r\npreferred not to be in the Paine house at that time; therefore, he made\r\nhis weekly visit on Thursday night.[C4-690] Actually, the party for one\r\nof the Paine\u2019s children was the preceding weekend, when Marina Oswald\r\nsuggested that Oswald remain in Dallas.[C4-691] When told that Frazier\r\nand Mrs. Randle had seen him carrying a long heavy package, Oswald\r\nreplied, \u201cWell, they was mistaken. That must have been some other\r\ntime he picked me up.\u201d[C4-692] In one interview, he told Fritz that\r\nthe only sack he carried to work that day was a lunch sack which he\r\nkept on his lap during the ride from Irving to Dallas.[C4-693] Frazier\r\ntestified before the Commission that Oswald carried no lunch sack that\r\nday.[C4-694]\r\n\r\n\r\nActions During and After Shooting\r\n\r\nDuring the first interrogation on November 22, Fritz asked Oswald to\r\naccount for himself at the time the President was shot. Oswald told him\r\nthat he ate lunch in the first-floor lunchroom and then went to the\r\nsecond floor for a Coke which he brought downstairs. He acknowledged\r\nthe encounter with the police officer on the second floor. Oswald\r\ntold Fritz that after lunch he went outside, talked with Foreman Bill\r\nShelley for 5 or 10 minutes and then left for home. He said that he\r\nleft work because Bill Shelley said that there would be no more work\r\ndone that day in the building.[C4-695] Shelley denied seeing Oswald\r\nafter 12 noon or at any time after the shooting.[C4-696] The next day,\r\nOswald added to his story. He stated that at the time the President was\r\nshot he was having lunch with \u201cJunior\u201d but he did not give Junior\u2019s\r\nlast name.[C4-697] The only employee at the Depository Building named\r\n\u201cJunior\u201d was James Jarman, Jr. Jarman testified that he ate his lunch\r\non the first floor around 5 minutes to 12, and that he neither ate\r\nlunch with nor saw Oswald.[C4-698] Jarman did talk to Oswald that\r\nmorning:\r\n\r\n    * * * he asked me what were the people gathering around on the\r\n    corner for and I told him that the President was supposed to\r\n    pass that morning, and he asked me did I know which way he was\r\n    coming, and I told him, yes, he probably come down Main and\r\n    turn on Houston and then back again on Elm. Then he said, \u201cOh,\r\n    I see,\u201d and that was all.[C4-699]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIOR ATTEMPT TO KILL\r\n\r\nThe Attempt on the Life of Maj. Gen. Edwin A.

Although the bullet was recovered\r\nfrom Walker\u2019s house (see app. X, p. 562), in the absence of a weapon\r\nit was of little investigatory value. General Walker hired two\r\ninvestigators to determine whether a former employee might have been\r\ninvolved in the shooting.[C4-703] Their results were negative. Until\r\nDecember 3, 1963, the Walker shooting remained unsolved.\r\n\r\nThe Commission evaluated the following evidence in considering whether\r\nLee Harvey Oswald fired the shot which almost killed General Walker:\r\n(1) A note which Oswald left for his wife on the evening of the\r\nshooting, (2) photographs found among Oswald\u2019s possessions after the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy, (3) firearm identification of the\r\nbullet found in Walker\u2019s home, and (4) admissions and other statements\r\nmade to Marina Oswald by Oswald concerning the shooting.\r\n\r\n_Note left by Oswald._--On December 2, 1963, Mrs. Ruth Paine turned\r\nover to the police some of the Oswalds\u2019 belongings, including a Russian\r\nvolume entitled \u201cBook of Useful Advice.\u201d[C4-704] In this book was an\r\nundated note written in Russian. In translation, the note read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    1. This is the key to the mailbox which is located in the main\r\n    post office in the city on Ervay Street. This is the same\r\n    street where the drugstore, in which you always waited is\r\n    located. You will find the mailbox in the post office which is\r\n    located 4 blocks from the drugstore on that street. I paid for\r\n    the box last month so don\u2019t worry about it.\r\n\r\n    2. Send the information as to what has happened to me to\r\n    the Embassy and include newspaper clippings (should there\r\n    be anything about me in the newspapers). I believe that the\r\n    Embassy will come quickly to your assistance on learning\r\n    everything.\r\n\r\n    3. I paid the house rent on the 2d so don\u2019t worry about it.\r\n\r\n    4. Recently I also paid for water and gas.\r\n\r\n    5. The money from work will possibly be coming. The money will\r\n    be sent to our post office box. Go to the bank and cash the\r\n    check.\r\n\r\n    6. You can either throw out or give my clothing, etc. away.\r\n    Do not keep these. However, I prefer that you hold on to my\r\n    personal papers (military, civil, etc.).\r\n\r\n    7. Certain of my documents are in the small blue valise.\r\n\r\n    8.

Cadigan, FBI handwriting expert, testified that this note was\r\nwritten by Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-706]\r\n\r\nPrior to the Walker shooting on April 10, Oswald had been attending\r\ntyping classes on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings. He had quit\r\nthese classes at least a week before the shooting, which occurred on\r\na Wednesday night.[C4-707] According to Marina Oswald\u2019s testimony, on\r\nthe night of the Walker shooting, her husband left their apartment on\r\nNeely Street shortly after dinner. She thought he was attending a class\r\nor was \u201con his own business.\u201d[C4-708] When he failed to return by 10\r\nor 10:30 p.m., Marina Oswald went to his room and discovered the note.\r\nShe testified: \u201cWhen he came back I asked him what had happened. He was\r\nvery pale. I don\u2019t remember the exact time, but it was very late. And\r\nhe told me not to ask him any questions. He only told me he had shot\r\nat General Walker.\u201d[C4-709] Oswald told his wife that he did not know\r\nwhether he had hit Walker; according to Marina Oswald when he learned\r\non the radio and in the newspapers the next day that he had missed,\r\nhe said that he \u201cwas very sorry that he had not hit him.\u201d[C4-710]\r\nMarina Oswald\u2019s testimony was fully supported by the note itself which\r\nappeared to be the work of a man expecting to be killed, or imprisoned,\r\nor to disappear. The last paragraph directed her to the jail and the\r\nother paragraphs instructed her on the disposal of Oswald\u2019s personal\r\neffects and the management of her affairs if he should not return.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the note was written while the Oswalds were living\r\nin Dallas before they moved to New Orleans in the spring of 1963. The\r\nreferences to house rent and payments for water and gas indicated that\r\nthe note was written when they were living in a rented apartment;\r\ntherefore it could not have been written while Marina Oswald was living\r\nwith the Paines. Moreover, the reference in paragraph 3 to paying \u201cthe\r\nhouse rent on the 2d\u201d would be consistent with the period when the\r\nOswalds were living on Neely Street since the apartment was rented on\r\nMarch 3, 1963. Oswald had paid the first month\u2019s rent in advance on\r\nMarch 2, 1963, and the second month\u2019s rent was paid on either April\r\n2 or April 3.[C4-711] The main post office \u201con Ervay Street\u201d refers\r\nto the post office where Oswald rented box 2915 from October 9, 1962,\r\nto May 14, 1963.[C4-712] Another statement which limits the time\r\nwhen it could have been written is the reference \u201cyou and the baby,\u201d\r\nwhich would indicate that it was probably written before the birth of\r\nOswald\u2019s second child on October 20, 1963.\r\n\r\nOswald had apparently mistaken the county jail for the city jail.\r\nFrom Neely Street the Oswalds would have traveled downtown on the\r\nBeckley bus, across the Commerce Street viaduct and into downtown\r\nDallas through the Triple Underpass.[C4-713] Either the viaduct or the\r\nunderpass might have been the \u201cbridge\u201d mentioned in the last paragraph\r\nof the note.

He showed her a notebook 3 days later\r\ncontaining photographs of General Walker\u2019s home and a map of the area\r\nwhere the house was located.[C4-714] Although Oswald destroyed the\r\nnotebook,[C4-715] three photographs found among Oswald\u2019s possessions\r\nafter the assassination were identified by Marina Oswald as photographs\r\nof General Walker\u2019s house.[C4-716] Two of these photographs were taken\r\nfrom the rear of Walker\u2019s house.[C4-717] The Commission confirmed, by\r\ncomparison with other photographs, that these were, indeed, photographs\r\nof the rear of Walker\u2019s house.[C4-718] An examination of the window at\r\nthe rear of the house, the wall through which the bullet passed, and\r\nthe fence behind the house indicated that the bullet was fired from a\r\nposition near the point where one of the photographs was taken.[C4-719]\r\n\r\nThe third photograph identified by Marina Oswald depicts the entrance\r\nto General Walker\u2019s driveway from a back alley.[C4-720] Also seen\r\nin the picture is the fence on which Walker\u2019s assailant apparently\r\nrested the rifle.[C4-721] An examination of certain construction work\r\nappearing in the background of this photograph revealed that the\r\npicture was taken between March 8 and 12, 1963, and most probably on\r\neither March 9 or March 10.[C4-722] Oswald purchased the money order\r\nfor the rifle on March 12, the rifle was shipped on March 20,[C4-723]\r\nand the shooting occurred on April 10. A photography expert with\r\nthe FBI was able to determine that this picture was taken with the\r\nImperial Reflex camera owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-724] (See app. X,\r\np. 596.)\r\n\r\nA fourth photograph, showing a stretch of railroad tracks, was\r\nalso identified by Marina Oswald as having been taken by her\r\nhusband, presumably in connection with the Walker shooting.[C4-725]\r\nInvestigation determined that this photograph was taken approximately\r\nseven-tenths of a mile from Walker\u2019s house.[C4-726] Another photograph\r\nof railroad tracks found among Oswald\u2019s possessions was not identified\r\nby his wife, but investigation revealed that it was taken from a point\r\nslightly less than half a mile from General Walker\u2019s house.[C4-727]\r\nMarina Oswald stated that when she asked her husband what he had done\r\nwith the rifle, he replied that he had buried it in the ground or\r\nhidden it in some bushes and that he also mentioned a railroad track in\r\nthis connection. She testified that several days later Oswald recovered\r\nhis rifle and brought it back to their apartment.[C4-728]\r\n\r\n_Firearms identification._--In the room beyond the one in which General\r\nWalker was sitting on the night of the shooting the Dallas police\r\nrecovered a badly mutilated bullet which had come to rest on a stack of\r\npaper.[C4-729] The Dallas City-County Investigation Laboratory tried to\r\ndetermine the type of weapon which fired the bullet.

Unless the missile or cartridge case can be identified\r\nas coming from a particular weapon to the exclusion of all others, the\r\nFBI refuses to draw any conclusion as to probability.[C4-733] Frazier\r\ntestified, however, that he found no microscopic characteristics or\r\nother evidence which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from\r\nthe Mannlicher-Carcano rifle owned by Lee Harvey Oswald. It was a\r\n6.5-millimeter bullet and, according to Frazier, \u201crelatively few\u201d types\r\nof rifles could produce the characteristics found on the bullet.[C4-734]\r\n\r\nJoseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal\r\nIdentification and Investigation, conducted an independent examination\r\nof this bullet and concluded \u201cthat there is a fair probability\u201d that\r\nthe bullet was fired from the rifle used in the assassination of\r\nPresident Kennedy.[C4-735] In explaining the difference between his\r\npolicy and that of the FBI on the matter of probable identification,\r\nNicol said:\r\n\r\n    I am aware of their position. This is not, I am sure, arrived\r\n    at without careful consideration. However, to say that because\r\n    one does not find sufficient marks for identification that\r\n    it is a negative, I think is going overboard in the other\r\n    direction. And for purposes of probative value, for whatever\r\n    it might be worth, in the absence of very definite negative\r\n    evidence, I think it is permissible to say that in an exhibit\r\n    such as 573 there is enough on it to say that it could have\r\n    come, and even perhaps a little stronger, to say that it\r\n    probably came from this, without going so far as to say to the\r\n    exclusion of all other guns. This I could not do.[C4-736]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Commission recognizes that neither expert was able to\r\nstate that the bullet which missed General Walker was fired from\r\nOswald\u2019s rifle to the exclusion of all others, this testimony was\r\nconsidered probative when combined with the other testimony linking\r\nOswald to the shooting.\r\n\r\n_Additional corroborative evidence._--The admissions made to Marina\r\nOswald by her husband are an important element in the evidence that Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald fired the shot at General Walker. As shown above, the\r\nnote and the photographs of Walker\u2019s house and of the nearby railroad\r\ntracks provide important corroboration for her account of the incident.\r\nOther details described by Marina Oswald coincide with facts developed\r\nindependently of her statements. She testified that her husband had\r\npostponed his attempt to kill Walker until that Wednesday because he\r\nhad heard that there was to be a gathering at the church next door\r\nto Walker\u2019s house on that evening. He indicated that he wanted more\r\npeople in the vicinity at the time of the attempt so that his arrival\r\nand departure would not attract great attention.[C4-737] An official\r\nof this church told FBI agents that services are held every Wednesday\r\nat the church except during the month of August.[C4-738] Marina Oswald\r\nalso testified that her husband had used a bus to return home.[C4-739]\r\nA study of the bus routes indicates that Oswald could have taken any\r\none of several different buses to Walker\u2019s house or to a point near the\r\nrailroad tracks where he may have concealed the rifle.", "start_char_idx": 494847, "end_char_idx": 499344, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dee3feaa-e871-40d2-9d02-e3221d992418": {"__data__": {"id_": "dee3feaa-e871-40d2-9d02-e3221d992418", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1edc28fa-8391-4709-8509-e2206db2c4e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "2e7975ff67f1771af74bd25b7a984e8f20a2ac2c24f70a9c75aa13ea23777727", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb50e124-b250-43e3-bf80-b4300432a2cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6e8c0a61a490bf8a5a15bbbda6f6d41308dc2034de589d5c541d7f7cf03e74e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Other details described by Marina Oswald coincide with facts developed\r\nindependently of her statements.

Edwin A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army) on April 10, 1963. The\r\nfinding that Lee Harvey Oswald attempted to murder a public figure in\r\nApril 1963 was considered of probative value in this investigation,\r\nalthough the Commission\u2019s conclusion concerning the identity of the\r\nassassin was based on evidence independent of the finding that Oswald\r\nattempted to kill General Walker.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard M. Nixon Incident\r\n\r\nAnother alleged threat by Oswald against a public figure involved\r\nformer Vice President Richard M. Nixon. In January 1964, Marina Oswald\r\nand her business manager, James Martin, told Robert Oswald, Lee Harvey\r\nOswald\u2019s brother, that Oswald had once threatened to shoot former\r\nVice President Richard M. Nixon.[C4-741] When Marina Oswald testified\r\nbefore the Commission on February 3-6, 1964, she had failed to mention\r\nthe incident when she was asked whether Oswald had ever expressed\r\nany hostility toward any official of the United States.[C4-742] The\r\nCommission first learned of this incident when Robert Oswald related it\r\nto FBI agents on February 19, 1964,[C4-743] and to the Commission on\r\nFebruary 21.[C4-744]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald appeared before the Commission again on June 11, 1964,\r\nand testified that a few days before her husband\u2019s departure from\r\nDallas to New Orleans on April 24, 1963, he finished reading a morning\r\nnewspaper \u201c* * * and put on a good suit. I saw that he took a pistol.\r\nI asked him where he was going, and why he was getting dressed. He\r\nanswered \u2018Nixon is coming. I want to go and have a look.\u2019\u201d He also said\r\nthat he would use the pistol if the opportunity arose.[C4-745] She\r\nreminded him that after the Walker shooting he had promised never to\r\nrepeat such an act. Marina Oswald related the events which followed:\r\n\r\n    I called him into the bathroom and I closed the door and I\r\n    wanted to prevent him and then I started to cry.

Johnson was in Dallas for\r\na visit which had been publicized in the Dallas newspapers throughout\r\nApril.[C4-754] The Commission asked Marina Oswald whether she might\r\nhave misunderstood the object of her husband\u2019s threat. She stated,\r\n\u201cthere is no question that in this incident it was a question of\r\nMr. Nixon.\u201d[C4-755] When asked later whether it might have been Mr.\r\nJohnson, she said, \u201cYes, no. I am getting a little confused with so\r\nmany questions. I was absolutely convinced it was Nixon and now after\r\nall these questions I wonder if I am right in my mind.\u201d[C4-756] She\r\nstated further that Oswald had only mentioned Nixon\u2019s name once during\r\nthe incident.[C4-757] Marina Oswald might have misunderstood her\r\nhusband. Mr. Johnson was the then Vice President and his visit took\r\nplace on April 23d.[C4-758] This was 1 day before Oswald left for New\r\nOrleans and Marina appeared certain that the Nixon incident \u201cwasn\u2019t the\r\nday before. Perhaps 3 days before.\u201d[C4-759]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald speculated that the incident may have been unrelated to\r\nan actual threat. She said,\r\n\r\n    * * * It might have been that he was just trying to test me.\r\n    He was the kind of person who could try and wound somebody in\r\n    that way. Possibly he didn\u2019t want to go out at all but was just\r\n    doing this all as a sort of joke, not really as a joke but\r\n    rather to simply wound me, to make me feel bad.[C4-760]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of other evidence that Oswald actually intended\r\nto shoot someone at this time, the Commission concluded that the\r\nincident, as described by Marina Oswald, was of no probative value in\r\nthe Commission\u2019s decision concerning the identity of the assassin of\r\nPresident Kennedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD\u2019S RIFLE CAPABILITY\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots which killed\r\nPresident Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally, the Commission\r\nconsidered whether Oswald, using his own rifle, possessed the\r\ncapability to hit his target with two out of three shots under the\r\nconditions described in chapter III. The Commission evaluated (1) the\r\nnature of the shots, (2) Oswald\u2019s Marine training in marksmanship, (3)\r\nhis experience and practice after leaving the Marine Corps, and (4) the\r\naccuracy of the weapon and the quality of the ammunition.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nature of the Shots\r\n\r\nFor a rifleman situated on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building the shots were at a slow-moving target proceeding\r\non a downgrade in virtually a straight line with the alinement of the\r\nassassin\u2019s rifle, at a range of 177 to 266 feet.[C4-761] An aerial\r\nphotograph of Dealey Plaza shows that Elm Street runs at an angle so\r\nthat the President would have been moving in an almost straight line\r\naway from the assassin\u2019s rifle.[C4-762] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n876, p. 33.)", "start_char_idx": 501858, "end_char_idx": 505840, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5ef037e-a7b5-4406-8ab1-9297a77b1bc7": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5ef037e-a7b5-4406-8ab1-9297a77b1bc7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8637dd2-f744-4858-9f0c-ce4d98781d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "163a8515bd021226f93f94b937d2cf324489d8c9f684da813fa6332caa529531", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb50e124-b250-43e3-bf80-b4300432a2cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../Data/WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_name": "WarrenCommissionReport.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 512405, "creation_date": "2024-05-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-30"}, "hash": "62b92bfd80942613412cc8494961e8581316060437943a2729f9916979f550d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Commission evaluated (1) the\r\nnature of the shots, (2) Oswald\u2019s Marine training in marksmanship, (3)\r\nhis experience and practice after leaving the Marine Corps, and (4) the\r\naccuracy of the weapon and the quality of the ammunition.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nature of the Shots\r\n\r\nFor a rifleman situated on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building the shots were at a slow-moving target proceeding\r\non a downgrade in virtually a straight line with the alinement of the\r\nassassin\u2019s rifle, at a range of 177 to 266 feet.[C4-761] An aerial\r\nphotograph of Dealey Plaza shows that Elm Street runs at an angle so\r\nthat the President would have been moving in an almost straight line\r\naway from the assassin\u2019s rifle.[C4-762] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n876, p. 33.) In addition, the 3\u00b0 downward slope of Elm Street was of\r\nassistance in eliminating at least some of the adjustment which is\r\nordinarily required when a marksman must raise his rifle as a target\r\nmoves farther away.[C4-763]\r\n\r\nFour marksmanship experts testified before the Commission. Maj.\r\nEugene D. Anderson, assistant head of the Marksmanship Branch of\r\nthe U.S. Marine Corps, testified that the shots which struck the\r\nPresident in the neck and in the head were \u201cnot * * * particularly\r\ndifficult.\u201d[C4-764] Robert A. Frazier, FBI expert in firearms\r\nidentification and training, said:\r\n\r\n    From my own experience in shooting over the years, when you\r\n    shoot at 175 feet or 260 feet, which is less than 100 yards,\r\n    with a telescopic sight, you should not have any difficulty in\r\n    hitting your target.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I mean it requires no training at all to shoot a weapon with a\r\n    telescopic sight once you know that you must put the crosshairs\r\n    on the target and that is all that is necessary.[C4-765]\r\n\r\nRonald Simmons, chief of the U.S. Army Infantry Weapons Evaluation\r\nBranch of the Ballistics Research Laboratory, said: \u201cWell, in order\r\nto achieve three hits, it would not be required that a man be an\r\nexceptional shot. A proficient man with this weapon, yes.\u201d[C4-766]\r\n\r\nThe effect of a four-power telescopic sight on the difficulty of\r\nthese shots was considered in detail by M. Sgt. James A. Zahm,\r\nnoncommissioned officer in charge of the Marksmanship Training Unit in\r\nthe Weapons Training Battalion of the Marine Corps School at Quantico,\r\nVa.[C4-767] Referring to a rifle with a four-power telescope, Sergeant\r\nZahm said:\r\n\r\n    * * * this is the ideal type of weapon for moving\r\n    targets * * *[C4-768]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    * * * Using the scope, rapidly working a bolt and using the\r\n    scope to relocate your target quickly and at the same time when\r\n    you locate that target you identify it and the crosshairs are\r\n    in close relationship to the point you want to shoot at, it\r\n    just takes a minor move in aiming to bring the crosshairs to\r\n    bear, and then it is a quick squeeze.[C4-769]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I consider it a real advantage, particularly at the range of\r\n    100 yards, in identifying your target. It allows you to see\r\n    your target clearly, and it is still of a minimum amount of\r\n    power that it doesn\u2019t exaggerate your own body movements. It\r\n    just is an aid in seeing in the fact that you only have the one\r\n    element, the crosshair, in relation to the target as opposed to\r\n    iron sights with aligning the sights and then aligning them on\r\n    the target.[C4-770]\r\n\r\nCharacterizing the four-power scope as \u201ca real aid, an extreme aid\u201d\r\nin rapid fire shooting, Sergeant Zahm expressed the opinion that the\r\nshot which struck President Kennedy in the neck at 176.9 to 190.8 feet\r\nwas \u201cvery easy\u201d and the shot which struck the President in the head\r\nat a distance of 265.3 feet was \u201can easy shot.\u201d[C4-771] After viewing\r\nphotographs depicting the alinement of Elm Street in relation to the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building, Zahm stated further:\r\n\r\n    This
