    "# LLM and RAG Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sources: [1](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/evaluating/), [2](), [3](), [4](), [5]()  \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on enormous bodies of data but they aren’t trained on your data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solves this problem by adding your data to the data LLMs already have access to. You will see references to RAG frequently in this documentation.  \n",
    "In RAG, your data is loaded and prepared for queries or “indexed”. User queries act on the index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then go to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.  \n",
    "Even if what you’re building is a chatbot or an agent, you’ll want to know RAG techniques for getting data into your application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation and benchmarking are crucial concepts in LLM development. To improve the performance of an LLM app (RAG, agents), you must have a way to measure it.\n",
    "\n",
    "LlamaIndex offers key modules to measure the quality of generated results. We also offer key modules to measure retrieval quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.Response Evaluation:  \n",
    "Does the response match the retrieved context? Does it also match the query? Does it match the reference answer or guidelines?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Retrieval Evaluation:  \n",
    "Are the retrieved sources relevant to the query?\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes how the evaluation components within LlamaIndex work.\n",
    "\n",
    "---  \n",
    "## 1. Response Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation of generated results can be difficult, since unlike traditional machine learning the predicted result isn't a single number, and it can be hard to define quantitative metrics for this problem. LlamaIndex offers LLM-based evaluation modules to measure the quality of results. This uses a \"gold\" LLM (e.g. GPT-4) to decide whether the predicted answer is correct in a variety of ways. Note that many of these current evaluation modules do not require ground-truth labels. Evaluation can be done with some combination of the query, context, response, and combine these with LLM calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluation modules are in the following forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ #### Correctness: Whether the generated answer matches that of the reference answer given the query (requires labels).\n",
    "+ #### Semantic Similarity Whether the predicted answer is semantically similar to the reference answer (requires labels).\n",
    "+ #### Faithfulness: Evaluates if the answer is faithful to the retrieved contexts (in other words, whether if there's hallucination).\n",
    "+ #### Context Relevancy: Whether retrieved context is relevant to the query.\n",
    "+ #### Answer Relevancy: Whether the generated answer is relevant to the query.\n",
    "+ #### Guideline Adherence: Whether the predicted answer adheres to specific guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Question Generation: In addition to evaluating queries, LlamaIndex can also use your data to generate questions to evaluate on. This means that you can automatically generate questions, and then run an evaluation pipeline to test if the LLM can actually answer questions accurately using your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 2. Retrieval Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide modules to help evaluate retrieval independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of retrieval evaluation is not new; given a dataset of questions and ground-truth rankings, we can evaluate retrievers using ranking metrics like mean-reciprocal rank (MRR), hit-rate, precision, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core retrieval evaluation steps revolve around the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ #### Dataset generation: Given an unstructured text corpus, synthetically generate (question, context) pairs.  \n",
    "+ #### Retrieval Evaluation: Given a retriever and a set of questions, evaluate retrieved results using ranking metrics.  \n",

They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain's lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping.

I remember vividly how impressed and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing programs right into the computer.\\n\\nComputers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.\\n\\nThough I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\\n\\nI couldn't have put this into words when I was 18.

I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world.

       "0  [What I Worked On\\n\\nFebruary 2021\\n\\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it.

    "`AnswerRelevancyEvaluator` and `ContextRelevancyEvaluator` give a measure on the relevancy of a generated answer and retrieved contexts, respectively, to a given user query. Both of these evaluators return a `score` that is between 0 and 1 as well as a generated `feedback` explaining the score. Note that, higher score means higher relevancy. In particular, we prompt the judge LLM to take a step-by-step approach in providing a relevancy score, asking it to answer the following two questions of a generated answer to a query for answer relevancy (for context relevancy these are slightly adjusted):\n",
